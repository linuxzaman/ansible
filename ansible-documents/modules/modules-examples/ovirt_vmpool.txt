EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Create VM pool from template
- ovirt_vmpool:
    cluster: mycluster
    name: myvmpool
    template: rhel7
    vm_count: 2
    prestarted: 2
    vm_per_user: 1

# Remove vmpool, note that all VMs in pool will be stopped and removed:
- ovirt_vmpool:
    state: absent
    name: myvmpool

# Change Pool Name
- ovirt_vmpool:
    id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    name: "new_pool_name"


RETURN VALUES:
