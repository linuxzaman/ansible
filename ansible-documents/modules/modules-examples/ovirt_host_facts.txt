EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Gather facts about all hosts which names start with C(host) and
# belong to data center C(west):
- ovirt_host_facts:
    pattern: name=host* and datacenter=west
- debug:
    var: ovirt_hosts
# All hosts with cluster version 4.2:
- ovirt_host_facts:
    pattern: name=host*
    cluster_version: "4.2"
- debug:
    var: ovirt_hosts


RETURN VALUES:

ovirt_hosts:
    description: "List of dictionaries describing the hosts. Host attributes are mapped to dictionary keys,
                  all hosts attributes can be found at following url: http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/master/#types/host."
    returned: On success.
    type: list
