RETURN VALUES:

creationTimestamp:
  description:
  - Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  returned: success
  type: str
description:
  description:
  - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
    the resource.
  returned: success
  type: str
id:
  description:
  - The unique identifier for the resource.
  returned: success
  type: int
IPAddress:
  description:
  - The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
  - Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme
    (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
  - When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address
    must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live
    in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral
    IPv4 address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional
    forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
    or IPv6.
  - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address
    belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default,
    if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically
    allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding
    rule.
  - 'An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference
    to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid: * 100.1.2.3
    * U(https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address)
    * projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address * regions/region/addresses/address
    * global/addresses/address * address .'
  returned: success
  type: str
IPProtocol:
  description:
  - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH,
    SCTP or ICMP.
  - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are valid.
  returned: success
  type: str
backendService:
  description:
  - A reference to a BackendService to receive the matched traffic.
  - This is used for internal load balancing.
  - "(not used for external load balancing) ."
  returned: success
  type: dict
ipVersion:
  description:
  - The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options are IPV4
    or IPV6. This can only be specified for a global forwarding rule.
  returned: success
  type: str
loadBalancingScheme:
  description:
  - 'This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can only take the
    following values: INTERNAL, EXTERNAL The value of INTERNAL means that this will
    be used for Internal Network Load Balancing (TCP, UDP). The value of EXTERNAL
    means that this will be used for External Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB, External
    TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy) .'
  returned: success
  type: str
name:
  description:
  - Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The
    name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
    name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
    which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
    characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
    which cannot be a dash.
  returned: success
  type: str
network:
  description:
  - For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced
    IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is not specified,
    the default network will be used.
  - This field is not used for external load balancing.
  returned: success
  type: dict
portRange:
  description:
  - This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy,
    TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, TargetInstance.
  - Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to
    ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
  - Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint
    port ranges.
  - 'Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports: * TargetHttpProxy:
    80, 8080 * TargetHttpsProxy: 443 * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443,
    465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1883, 5222 * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443,

  returned: success
  type: str
ports:
  description:
  - This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load balancing.
  - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a single port or a comma separated
    list of ports can be configured. Only packets addressed to these ports will be
    forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
  - You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports.
  returned: success
  type: list
subnetwork:
  description:
  - A reference to a subnetwork.
  - For internal load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the load
    balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
  - If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However,
    if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be specified.
  - This field is not used for external load balancing.
  returned: success
  type: dict
region:
  description:
  - A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
  - This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
  returned: success
  type: str
target:
  description:
  - This target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must
    be of a type appropriate to the target object.
  - 'Valid types: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, SSL_PROXY, TCP_PROXY .'
  returned: success
  type: str
