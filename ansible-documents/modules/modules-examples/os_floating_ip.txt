# Assign a floating IP to the fist interface of `cattle001` from an exiting
# external network or nova pool. A new floating IP from the first available
# external network is allocated to the project.

     server: cattle001

# Assign a new floating IP to the instance fixed ip `192.0.2.3` of
# `cattle001`. If a free floating IP is already allocated to the project, it is
# reused; if not, a new one is created.
