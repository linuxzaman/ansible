EXAMPLES:

# Following playbook creates, rebuilds instances, resizes and then deletes a MIG.
# Notes:
# - Two valid Instance Templates must exist in your GCE project in order to run
#   this playbook.  Change the fields to match the templates used in your
#   project.
# - The use of the 'pause' module is not required, it is just for convenience.
