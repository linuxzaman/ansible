EXAMPLES:

# Gather secrets from 1Password, assuming there is a 'password' field:
- name: Get a password
  onepassword_facts:
    search_terms: My 1Password item
  delegate_to: localhost
  no_log: true         # Don't want to log the secrets to the console!

# Gather secrets from 1Password, with more advanced search terms:
- name: Get a password
  onepassword_facts:
    search_terms:
      - name:    My 1Password item
        field:   Custom field name       # optional, defaults to 'password'
        section: Custom section name     # optional, defaults to 'None'
        vault:   Name of the vault       # optional, only necessary if there is more than 1 Vault available
  delegate_to: localhost
  no_log: True                           # Don't want to log the secrets to the console!

# Gather secrets combining simple and advanced search terms to retrieve two items, one of which we fetch two
# fields. In the first 'password' is fetched, as a field name is not specified (default behaviour) and in the
# second, 'Custom field name' is fetched, as that is specified explicitly.
- name: Get a password
  onepassword_facts:
    search_terms:
      - My 1Password item                # 'name' is optional when passing a simple string...
      - name: My Other 1Password item    # ...but it can also be set for consistency
      - name:    My 1Password item
        field:   Custom field name       # optional, defaults to 'password'
        section: Custom section name     # optional, defaults to 'None'
        vault:   Name of the vault       # optional, only necessary if there is more than 1 Vault available
      - name: A 1Password item with document attachment
  delegate_to: localhost
  no_log: true                           # Don't want to log the secrets to the console!
