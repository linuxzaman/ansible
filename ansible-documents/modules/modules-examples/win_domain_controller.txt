# ensure a server is not a domain controller
# note that without an action wrapper, in the case where a DC is demoted,
# the task will fail with a 401 Unauthorized, because the domain credential
# becomes invalid to fetch the final output over WinRM. This requires win_async
# with credential switching (or other clever credential-switching
# mechanism to get the output and trigger the required reboot)
