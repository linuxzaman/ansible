RETURN VALUES:

destRange:
  description:
  - The destination range of outgoing packets that this route applies to.
  - Only IPv4 is supported.
  returned: success
  type: str
description:
  description:
  - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
    the resource.
  returned: success

    which cannot be a dash.
  returned: success
  type: str
network:
  description:
  - The network that this route applies to.
  returned: success
  type: dict
priority:
  description:
  - The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases where there
    is more than one matching route of equal prefix length.
  - In the case of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the lowest-numbered
    priority value wins.
  - Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through 65535.
  returned: success
  type: int
tags:
  description:
  - A list of instance tags to which this route applies.
  returned: success
  type: list
nextHopGateway:
  description:
  - URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets.
  - 'Currently, you can only specify the internet gateway, using a full or partial
    valid URL: * U(https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway)

  returned: success
  type: str
nextHopInstance:
  description:
  - URL to an instance that should handle matching packets.
  - 'You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example: * U(https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/)
