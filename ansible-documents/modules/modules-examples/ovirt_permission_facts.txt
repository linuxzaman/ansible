EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Gather facts about all permissions of user with username C(john):
- ovirt_permission_facts:
    user_name: john
    authz_name: example.com-authz
- debug:
    var: ovirt_permissions


RETURN VALUES:

ovirt_permissions:
    description: "List of dictionaries describing the permissions. Permission attributes are mapped to dictionary keys,
                  all permissions attributes can be found at following url: http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/master/#types/permission."
    returned: On success.
