EXAMPLES:

# This will also create a default DB user with the same
  # name as the database, and the specified password.

  - name: Create a database
    webfaction_db:
      name: "{{webfaction_user}}_db1"
      password: mytestsql
      type: mysql
      login_name: "{{webfaction_user}}"
      login_password: "{{webfaction_passwd}}"
      machine: "{{webfaction_machine}}"

  # Note that, for symmetry's sake, deleting a database using
  # 'state: absent' will also delete the matching user.
