EXAMPLES:

---
# This example adds a rule to redirect queries from a specific user to another
# hostgroup, it saves the mysql query rule config to disk, but avoids loading
# the mysql query config config to runtime (this might be because several
# rules are being added and the user wants to push the config to runtime in a
# single batch using the M(proxysql_manage_config) module). It uses supplied
# credentials to connect to the proxysql admin interface.

- proxysql_query_rules:
    login_user: admin
    login_password: admin
    username: 'guest_ro'
    match_pattern: "^SELECT.*"
    destination_hostgroup: 1
    active: 1
    retries: 3
    state: present
    load_to_runtime: False

# This example removes all rules that use the username 'guest_ro', saves the
# mysql query rule config to disk, and dynamically loads the mysql query rule
# config to runtime.  It uses credentials in a supplied config file to connect
# to the proxysql admin interface.

- proxysql_query_rules:
    config_file: '~/proxysql.cnf'
    username: 'guest_ro'
    state: absent
    force_delete: true


RETURN VALUES:

stdout:
    description: The mysql user modified or removed from proxysql
    returned: On create/update will return the newly modified rule, in all
              other cases will return a list of rules that match the supplied
              criteria.
