EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Create administrative role with two permits
- ovirt_role:
    name: role
    administrative: true
    permits:
      - manipulate_permissions
      - create_instance

# Remove role
- ovirt_role:
    name: role
    state: absent

# Remove all permit
- ovirt_role:
    name: role
    administrative: ture
    permits:
      - login


RETURN VALUES:

ovirt_role:
    description: "List of dictionaries describing the Roles. Role attributes are mapped to dictionary keys,
                  all Roles attributes can be found at following url: http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/master/#types/role."
    returned: On success.
    type: list
