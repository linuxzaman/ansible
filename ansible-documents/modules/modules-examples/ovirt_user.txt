EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Add user user1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
- ovirt_user:
    name: user1
    domain: example.com-authz

# Add user user1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
# In case of Active Directory specify UPN:
- ovirt_user:
    name: user1@ad2.example.com
    domain: example.com-authz

# Remove user user1 with authorization provider example.com-authz
- ovirt_user:
    state: absent
    name: user1
    authz_name: example.com-authz
