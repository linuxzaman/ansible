name:
  description:
  - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The

    name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
    which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
    characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
    which cannot be a dash.
  returned: success
  type: str
sizeGb:
  description:
  - Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when
    creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter,
    or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk.

    of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of the
    snapshot.

    a default value is used. Currently supported sizes are 4096 and 16384, other sizes
    may be added in the future.
  - If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will list the supported
    values for the caller's project.
  returned: success

    disk. Provide this when creating the disk.
  returned: success
  type: str
sourceImage:
  description:
  - The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted, this
    field will not be set.
  - 'To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the
    image by its family name. For example, specify family/debian-8 to use the latest
    Debian 8 image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-8 Alternatively,
    use a specific version of a public operating system image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD
    To create a disk with a private image that you created, specify the image name
    in the following format: global/images/my-private-image You can also specify a
    private image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the image
    in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name: global/images/family/my-private-family
    .'
  returned: success
  type: str
zone:
  description:
  - A reference to the zone where the disk resides.

    rawKey:
      description:
      - Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in RFC 4648
        base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.

sourceImageId:
  description:
  - The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value identifies the
    exact image that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you
    created the persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and recreated
    under the same name, the source image ID would identify the exact version of the
    image that was used.
  returned: success
  type: str
diskEncryptionKey:
  description:
  - Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
  - After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same
    key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot or an image, or
    to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
  - Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.
  - If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk
    will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to
    provide a key to use the disk later.

sourceSnapshotId:
  description:
  - The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies
    the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For example,
    if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and

    version of the snapshot that was used.
