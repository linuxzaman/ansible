RETURN VALUES:

alternativeLocationId:
  description:
  - Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance against zonal
    failures by provisioning it across two zones.
  - If provided, it must be a different zone from the one provided in [locationId].
  returned: success

  - The current zone where the Redis endpoint is placed.
  - For Basic Tier instances, this will always be the same as the [locationId] provided
    by the user at creation time. For Standard Tier instances, this can be either
    [locationId] or [alternativeLocationId] and can change after a failover event.
  returned: success
  type: str
displayName:

    .'
  returned: success
  type: dict
locationId:
  description:
  - The zone where the instance will be provisioned. If not provided, the service

    is also provided, it must be different from [locationId].
  returned: success
  type: str
name:
