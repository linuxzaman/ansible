EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

- name: Add user user1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
  ovirt_permission:
    user_name: user1
    authz_name: example.com-authz
    object_type: vm
    object_name: myvm
    role: UserVmManager

- name: Remove permission from user
  ovirt_permission:
    state: absent
    user_name: user1
    authz_name: example.com-authz
    object_type: cluster
    object_name: mycluster
    role: ClusterAdmin

- name: Assign QuotaConsumer role to user
  ovirt_permissions:
    state: present
    user_name: user1
    authz_name: example.com-authz
    object_type: data_center
    object_name: mydatacenter
    quota_name: myquota
    role: QuotaConsumer
