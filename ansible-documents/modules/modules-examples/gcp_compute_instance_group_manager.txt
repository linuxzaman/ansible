RETURN VALUES:

baseInstanceName:
  description:
  - The base instance name to use for instances in this group. The value must be 1-58
    characters long. Instances are named by appending a hyphen and a random four-character
    string to the base instance name.

    abandoning:
      description:
      - The total number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled
        to be abandoned. Abandoning an instance removes it from the managed instance
        group without deleting it.
      returned: success
      type: int
    creating:
      description:
      - The number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to
        be created or are currently being created. If the group fails to create any
        of these instances, it tries again until it creates the instance successfully.
      - If you have disabled creation retries, this field will not be populated; instead,
        the creatingWithoutRetries field will be populated.
      returned: success
      type: int
    creatingWithoutRetries:
      description:
      - The number of instances that the managed instance group will attempt to create.
        The group attempts to create each instance only once. If the group fails to
        create any of these instances, it decreases the group's targetSize value accordingly.
      returned: success

    recreating:
      description:
      - The number of instances in the managed instance group that are scheduled to
        be recreated or are currently being being recreated.
      - Recreating an instance deletes the existing root persistent disk and creates
        a new disk from the image that is defined in the instance template.
      returned: success

    refreshing:
      description:

        setting or removing target pools for the instance.
      returned: success
