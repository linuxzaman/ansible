EXAMPLES:

- name: Create secret foo (from a file on the control machine)
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    # If the file is JSON or binary, Ansible might modify it (because
    # it is first decoded and later re-encoded). Base64-encoding the
    # file directly after reading it prevents this to happen.
    data: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/secret/file') | b64encode }}"
    data_is_b64: true
    state: present

- name: Change the secret data
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    data: Goodnight everyone!
    labels:
      bar: baz
      one: '1'
    state: present

- name: Add a new label
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    data: Goodnight everyone!
    labels:
      bar: baz
      one: '1'
      # Adding a new label will cause a remove/create of the secret
      two: '2'
    state: present

- name: No change
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    data: Goodnight everyone!
    labels:
      bar: baz
      one: '1'
      # Even though 'two' is missing, there is no change to the existing secret
    state: present

- name: Update an existing label
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    data: Goodnight everyone!
    labels:
      bar: monkey   # Changing a label will cause a remove/create of the secret
      one: '1'
    state: present

- name: Force the removal/creation of the secret
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    data: Goodnight everyone!
    force: yes
    state: present

- name: Remove secret foo
  docker_secret:
    name: foo
    state: absent
