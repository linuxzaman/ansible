RETURN VALUES:

labelFingerprint:
  description:
  - The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource. Used internally
    during updates.
  returned: success
  type: str
creationTimestamp:
  description:
  - Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  returned: success
  type: str
description:
  description:
  - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
    the resource.
  returned: success
  type: str
id:
  description:
  - The unique identifier for the resource.
  returned: success
  type: int
lastAttachTimestamp:
  description:
  - Last attach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  returned: success
  type: str
lastDetachTimestamp:
  description:
  - Last dettach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  returned: success
  type: str
labels:
  description:
  - Labels to apply to this disk. A list of key->value pairs.
  returned: success
  type: dict
licenses:
  description:
  - Any applicable publicly visible licenses.
  returned: success
  type: list
name:
  description:
  - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The
    name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
    name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
    which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
    characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
    which cannot be a dash.
  returned: success
  type: str
sizeGb:
  description:
  - Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when
    creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter,
    or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk.
  - If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot, the value
    of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of the
    snapshot.
  returned: success
  type: int
users:
  description:
  - 'Links to the users of the disk (attached instances) in form: project/zones/zone/instances/instance
    .'
  returned: success
  type: list
physicalBlockSizeBytes:
  description:
  - Physical block size of the persistent disk, in bytes. If not present in a request,
    a default value is used. Currently supported sizes are 4096 and 16384, other sizes
    may be added in the future.
  - If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will list the supported
    values for the caller's project.
  returned: success
  type: int
replicaZones:
  description:
  - URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated to.
  returned: success
  type: list
type:
  description:
  - URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to create the
    disk. Provide this when creating the disk.
  returned: success
  type: str
region:
  description:
  - A reference to the region where the disk resides.
  returned: success
  type: str
diskEncryptionKey:
  description:
  - Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
  - After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same
    key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot or an image, or
    to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
  - Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.
  - If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk
    will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to
    provide a key to use the disk later.
  returned: success
  type: complex
  contains:
    rawKey:
      description:
      - Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in RFC 4648
        base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.
      returned: success
      type: str
    sha256:
      description:
      - The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied encryption
        key that protects this resource.
      returned: success
      type: str
sourceSnapshot:
  description:
  - The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial
    or full URL to the resource.
  returned: success
  type: dict
sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey:
  description:
  - The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required if the source
    snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
  returned: success
  type: complex
  contains:
    rawKey:
      description:
      - Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in RFC 4648
        base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.
      returned: success
      type: str
    sha256:
      description:
      - The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied encryption
        key that protects this resource.
      returned: success
      type: str
sourceSnapshotId:
  description:
  - The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies
    the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For example,
    if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and
    recreated under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact
    version of the snapshot that was used.
  returned: success
  type: str
