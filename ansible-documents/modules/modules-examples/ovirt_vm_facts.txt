EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Gather facts about all VMs which names start with C(centos) and
# belong to cluster C(west):
- ovirt_vm_facts:
    pattern: name=centos* and cluster=west
- debug:
    var: ovirt_vms

# Gather info about next run configuration of virtual machine named myvm
- ovirt_vm_facts:
    pattern: name=myvm
    next_run: true
- debug:
    var: ovirt_vms[0]
