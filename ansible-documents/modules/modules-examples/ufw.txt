EXAMPLES:

- name: Allow everything and enable UFW
  ufw:
    state: enabled
    policy: allow

- name: Set logging
  ufw:
    logging: on

# Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is
# being denied, rather than simply ignoring it. In these cases, use
# reject instead of deny. In addition, log rejected connections:
- ufw:
    rule: reject
    port: auth
    log: yes

# ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
# against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
# address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
# 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
# for details. Typical usage is:
- ufw:
    rule: limit
    port: ssh
    proto: tcp

# Allow OpenSSH. (Note that as ufw manages its own state, simply removing
# a rule=allow task can leave those ports exposed. Either use delete=yes
# or a separate state=reset task)
- ufw:
    rule: allow
    name: OpenSSH

- name: Delete OpenSSH rule
  ufw:
    rule: allow
    name: OpenSSH
    delete: yes

- name: Deny all access to port 53
  ufw:
    rule: deny
    port: 53

- name: Allow port range 60000-61000
  ufw:
    rule: allow
    port: 60000:61000
    proto: tcp

- name: Allow all access to tcp port 80
  ufw:
    rule: allow
    port: 80
    proto: tcp

- name: Allow all access from RFC1918 networks to this host
  ufw:
    rule: allow
    src: '{{ item }}'
  loop:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 172.16.0.0/12

- name: Deny access to udp port 514 from host 1.2.3.4 and include a comment
  ufw:
    rule: deny
    proto: udp
    src: 1.2.3.4
    port: 514
    comment: Block syslog

- name: Allow incoming access to eth0 from 1.2.3.5 port 5469 to 1.2.3.4 port 5469
  ufw:

    src: 1.2.3.5

    dest: 1.2.3.4

# Note that IPv6 must be enabled in /etc/default/ufw for IPv6 firewalling to work.
- name: Deny all traffic from the IPv6 2001:db8::/32 to tcp port 25 on this host
  ufw:
    rule: deny
    proto: tcp
    src: 2001:db8::/32
    port: 25

- name: Deny all IPv6 traffic to tcp port 20 on this host
  # this should be the first IPv6 rule
  ufw:
    rule: deny
    proto: tcp
    port: 20
    to_ip: "::"
    insert: 0
    insert_relative_to: first-ipv6

- name: Deny all IPv4 traffic to tcp port 20 on this host
  # This should be the third to last IPv4 rule
  # (insert: -1 addresses the second to last IPv4 rule;
  #  so the new rule will be inserted before the second
  #  to last IPv4 rule, and will be come the third to last
  #  IPv4 rule.)
  ufw:
    rule: deny
    proto: tcp
    port: 20
    to_ip: "::"
    insert: -1
    insert_relative_to: last-ipv4

# Can be used to further restrict a global FORWARD policy set to allow
- name: Deny forwarded/routed traffic from subnet 1.2.3.0/24 to subnet 4.5.6.0/24
  ufw:
    rule: deny
    route: yes
