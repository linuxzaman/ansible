EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# In all examples the durability of the configuration created is dependent on the 'save' option value:

# Create bond on eth0 and eth1 interface, and put 'myvlan' network on top of it and persist the new configuration:
- name: Bonds
  ovirt_host_network:
    name: myhost
    save: yes
    bond:
      name: bond0
      mode: 2
      interfaces:
        - eth1
        - eth2
    networks:
      - name: myvlan
        boot_protocol: static
        address: 1.2.3.4
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        gateway: 1.2.3.4
        version: v4

# Create bond on eth1 and eth2 interface, specifiyng both mode and miimon:
- name: Bonds
  ovirt_host_network:
    name: myhost
    bond:
      name: bond0
      mode: 1
      options:
        miimon: 200
      interfaces:
        - eth1
        - eth2

# Remove bond0 bond from host interfaces:
- ovirt_host_network:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    bond:
      name: bond0

# Assign myvlan1 and myvlan2 vlans to host eth0 interface:
- ovirt_host_network:
    name: myhost
    interface: eth0
    networks:
      - name: myvlan1
      - name: myvlan2

# Remove myvlan2 vlan from host eth0 interface:
- ovirt_host_network:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    interface: eth0
    networks:
      - name: myvlan2

# Remove all networks/vlans from host eth0 interface:
- ovirt_host_network:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    interface: eth0
