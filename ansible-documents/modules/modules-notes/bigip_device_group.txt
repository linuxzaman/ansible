> BIGIP_DEVICE_GROUP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_group.py)

        Managing device groups allows you to create HA pairs and clusters of BIG-IP devices. Usage of this module should be done in
        conjunction with the `bigip_configsync_actions' to sync configuration across the pair or cluster if auto-sync is disabled.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auto_sync
        Indicates whether configuration synchronization occurs manually or automatically.
        When creating a new device group, this option will default to `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- description
        Description of the device group.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- full_sync
        Specifies whether the system synchronizes the entire configuration during synchronization operations.
        When `no', the system performs incremental synchronization operations, based on the cache size specified in
        `max_incremental_sync_size'.
        Incremental configuration synchronization is a mechanism for synchronizing a device-group's configuration among its members,
        without requiring a full configuration load for each configuration change.
        In order for this to work, all devices in the device-group must initially agree on the configuration. Typically this requires at
        least one full configuration load to each device.
        When creating a new device group, this option will default to `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- max_incremental_sync_size
        Specifies the size of the changes cache for incremental sync.
        For example, using the default, if you make more than 1024 KB worth of incremental changes, the system performs a full
        synchronization operation.
        Using incremental synchronization operations can reduce the per-device sync/load time for configuration changes.
        This setting is relevant only when `full_sync' is `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= name
        Specifies the name of the device group.

        type: str

- network_failover
        Indicates whether failover occurs over the network or is hard-wired.
        This parameter is only valid for `type''s that are `sync-failover'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7

            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.

NOTES:
      * This module is primarily used as a component of configuring HA pairs of BIG-IP devices.
      * Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.x.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
