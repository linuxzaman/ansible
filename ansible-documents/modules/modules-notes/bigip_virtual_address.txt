        Manage LTM virtual addresses on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        Virtual address. This value cannot be modified after it is set.
        If you never created a virtual address, but did create virtual servers, then a virtual address for each virtual server was
        created automatically. The name of this virtual address is its IP address value.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- arp
        Specifies whether the system accepts ARP requests.
        When `no', specifies that the system does not accept ARP requests.
        When `yes', then the packets are dropped.
        Note that both ARP and ICMP Echo must be disabled in order for forwarding virtual servers using that virtual address to forward
        ICMP packets.
        When creating a new virtual address, if this parameter is not specified, the default value is `yes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7
        

- arp_state
        Specifies whether the system accepts ARP requests. When (disabled), specifies that the system does not accept ARP requests. Note
        that both ARP and ICMP Echo must be disabled in order for forwarding virtual servers using that virtual address to forward ICMP
        packets. If (enabled), then the packets are dropped.
        Deprecated. Use the `arp' parameter instead.
        When creating a new virtual address, if this parameter is not specified, the default value is `enabled'.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- auto_delete
        Specifies whether the system automatically deletes the virtual address with the deletion of the last associated virtual server.
        When `disabled', specifies that the system leaves the virtual address even when all associated virtual servers have been deleted.
        When creating the virtual address, the default value is `enabled'.
        `enabled' and `disabled' are deprecated and will be removed in Ansible 2.11. Instead, use known Ansible booleans such as `yes'
        and `no'
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- availability_calculation
        Specifies what routes of the virtual address the system advertises. When `when_any_available', advertises the route when any
        virtual server is available. When `when_all_available', advertises the route when all virtual servers are available. When
        (always), always advertises the route regardless of the virtual servers available.
        (Aliases: advertise_route)(Choices: always, when_all_available, when_any_available)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

- connection_limit
        Specifies the number of concurrent connections that the system allows on this virtual address.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- icmp_echo
        Specifies how the systems sends responses to (ICMP) echo requests on a per-virtual address basis for enabling route
        advertisement. When `enabled', the BIG-IP system intercepts ICMP echo request packets and responds to them directly. When
        `disabled', the BIG-IP system passes ICMP echo requests through to the backend servers. When (selective), causes the BIG-IP
        system to internally enable or disable responses based on virtual server state; `when_any_available', `when_all_available, or
        C(always', regardless of the state of any virtual servers.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled, selective)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- name
        Name of the virtual address.
        If this parameter is not provided, then the value of `address' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

- netmask
        Netmask of the provided virtual address. This value cannot be modified after it is set.
        When creating a new virtual address, if this parameter is not specified, the default value is `255.255.255.255' for IPv4
        addresses and `ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff' for IPv6 addresses.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

            - You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for

        type: dict
        version_added: 2.5

- route_advertisement
        Specifies whether the system uses route advertisement for this virtual address.
        When disabled, the system does not advertise routes for this virtual address.
        The majority of these options are only supported on versions 13.0.0-HF1 or higher. On versions less than this, all choices expect
        `disabled' will translate to `enabled'.
        When `always', the BIG-IP system will always advertise the route for the virtual address, regardless of availability status. This
        requires an `enabled' virtual address.
        When `enabled', the BIG-IP system will advertise the route for the available virtual address, based on the calculation method in
        the availability calculation.
        When `disabled', the BIG-IP system will not advertise the route for the virtual address, regardless of the availability status.
        When `selective', you can also selectively enable ICMP echo responses, which causes the BIG-IP system to internally enable or
        disable responses based on virtual server state. Either `any' virtual server, `all' virtual servers, or `always', regardless of
        the state of any virtual server.
        When `any', the BIG-IP system will advertise the route for the virtual address when any virtual server is available.
        When `all', the BIG-IP system will advertise the route for the virtual address when all virtual servers are available.
        (Choices: disabled, enabled, always, selective, any, all)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

- route_domain
        The route domain of the `address' that you want to use.
        This value cannot be modified after it is set.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- spanning
        Enables all BIG-IP systems in a device group to listen for and process traffic on the same virtual address.
        Spanning for a virtual address occurs when you enable the `spanning' option on a device and then sync the virtual address to the
        other members of the device group.
        Spanning also relies on the upstream router to distribute application flows to the BIG-IP systems using ECMP routes. ECMP defines
        a route to the virtual address using distinct Floating self-IP addresses configured on each BIG-IP system.
        You must also configure MAC masquerade addresses and disable `arp' on the virtual address when Spanning is enabled.
        When creating a new virtual address, if this parameter is not specified, the default valus is `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7
        

- state
        The virtual address state. If `absent', an attempt to delete the virtual address will be made. This will only succeed if this
        virtual address is not in use by a virtual server. `present' creates the virtual address and enables it. If `enabled', enable the
        virtual address if it exists. If `disabled', create the virtual address if needed, and set state to `disabled'.
        (Choices: present, absent, enabled, disabled)[Default: present]
        type: str

- traffic_group
        The traffic group for the virtual address. When creating a new address, if this value is not specified, the default of `/Common
        /traffic-group-1' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

- use_route_advertisement
        Specifies whether the system uses route advertisement for this virtual address.
        When disabled, the system does not advertise routes for this virtual address.
        Deprecated. Use the `route_advertisement' parameter instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
