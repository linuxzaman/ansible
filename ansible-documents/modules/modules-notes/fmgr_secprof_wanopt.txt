  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- adom
        The ADOM the configuration should belong to.
        [Default: root]

- auth_group
        Optionally add an authentication group to restrict access to the WAN Optimization tunnel to peers in the authentication group.
        [Default: (null)]

- cifs
        EXPERTS ONLY! KNOWLEDGE OF FMGR JSON API IS REQUIRED!
        List of multiple child objects to be added. Expects a list of dictionaries.
        Dictionaries must use FortiManager API parameters, not the ansible ones listed below.
        If submitted, all other prefixed sub-parameters ARE IGNORED.
        This object is MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE with its options.
