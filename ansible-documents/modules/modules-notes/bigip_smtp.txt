> BIGIP_SMTP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_smtp.py)

        Allows configuring of the BIG-IP to send mail via an SMTP server by configuring the parameters of an SMTP server.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- authentication
        Credentials can be set on an SMTP server's configuration even if that authentication is not used (think staging configs or
        emergency changes). This parameter acts as a switch to make the specified `smtp_server_username' and `smtp_server_password'
        parameters active or not.
        When `yes', the authentication parameters will be active.
        When `no', the authentication parameters will be inactive.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
