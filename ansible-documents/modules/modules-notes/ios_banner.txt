        This will configure both login and motd banners on remote devices running Cisco IOS.  It allows playbooks to add or remote banner
        text from the active running configuration.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= banner
        Specifies which banner should be configured on the remote device. In Ansible 2.4 and earlier only `login' and `motd' were
        supported.
        (Choices: login, motd, exec, incoming, slip-ppp)

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
