              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,

NOTES:
      * Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
      * `state=absent' removes the whole BGP ASN configuration when `vrf=default' or the whole VRF instance within the BGP process
        when using a different VRF.
      * Default when supported restores params default value.
      * Configuring global parmas is only permitted if `vrf=default'.
