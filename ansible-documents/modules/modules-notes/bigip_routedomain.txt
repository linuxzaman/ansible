        Manage route domains on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- bwc_policy
        The bandwidth controller for the route domain.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- connection_limit
        The maximum number of concurrent connections allowed for the route domain. Setting this to `0' turns off connection limits.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- description
        Specifies descriptive text that identifies the route domain.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- flow_eviction_policy
        The eviction policy to use with this route domain. Apply an eviction policy to provide customized responses to flow overflows and
        slow flows on the route domain.

- id
        The unique identifying integer representing the route domain.
        This field is required when creating a new route domain.
        In version 2.5, this value is no longer used to reference a route domain when making modifications to it (for instance during
        update and delete operations). Instead, the `name' parameter is used. In version 2.6, the `name' value will become a required
        parameter.

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
