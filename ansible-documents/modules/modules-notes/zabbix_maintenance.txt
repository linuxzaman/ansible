        (Aliases: host_group)[Default: (null)]

- host_names
        Hosts to manage maintenance window for. Separate multiple hosts with commas. `host_name' is an alias for `host_names'. *Required*
        option when `state' is `present' and no `host_groups' specified.
        (Aliases: host_name)[Default: (null)]

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.1

        [Default: 10]

        Unique name of maintenance window.


= server_url
        URL of Zabbix server, with protocol (http or https). `url' is an alias for `server_url'.
        (Aliases: url)
        type: str

- state
        Create or remove a maintenance window. Maintenance window to remove is identified by name.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- timeout
        The timeout of API request (seconds).
        [Default: 10]
        type: int

        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5


NOTES:
      * Useful for setting hosts in maintenance mode before big update, and removing maintenance window after update.
      * Module creates maintenance window from now() to now() + minutes, so if Zabbix server's time and host's time are not
        synchronized, you will get strange results.
      * Install required module with 'pip install zabbix-api' command.


REQUIREMENTS:  python >= 2.6, zabbix-api
