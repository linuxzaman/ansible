> FORTIOS_WEB_PROXY_EXPLICIT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_web_proxy_explicit.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify web_proxy feature and explicit
        category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= host
        FortiOS or FortiGate ip address.


- https
        Indicates if the requests towards FortiGate must use HTTPS protocol
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- password
        FortiOS or FortiGate password.
        [Default: ]

= username
        FortiOS or FortiGate username.


- vdom
