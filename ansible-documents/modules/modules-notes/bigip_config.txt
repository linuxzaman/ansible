> BIGIP_CONFIG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_config.py)

        Manages a BIG-IP configuration by allowing TMSH commands that modify running configuration, or merge SCF formatted files into the
        running configuration. Additionally, this module is of significant importance because it allows you to save your running
        configuration to disk. Since the F5 module only manipulate running configuration, it is important that you utilize this module to
        save that running config.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- merge_content
        Loads the specified configuration that you want to merge into the running configuration. This is equivalent to using the `tmsh'
        command `load sys config from-terminal merge'.
        If you need to read configuration from a file or template, use Ansible's `file' or `template' lookup plugins respectively.
        [Default: (null)]

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)

- provider

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the

        type: bool

- save
        The `save' argument instructs the module to save the running-config to startup-config.
        This operation is performed after any changes are made to the current running config. If no changes are made, the configuration

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
