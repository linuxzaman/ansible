        Create, Update or Destroy a Managed Instance Group (MIG).  See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups for an
        overview. Full install/configuration instructions for the gce* modules can be found in the comments of ansible/test/gce_tests.py.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- autoscaling
        A dictionary of configuration for the autoscaler. 'enabled (bool)', 'name (str)' and policy.max_instances (int) are required
        fields if autoscaling is used. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/beta/autoscalers for more information on
        Autoscaling.
        [Default: (null)]

        Path to the JSON file associated with the service account email
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the Managed Instance Group.

        Define named ports that backend services can forward data to.  Format is a a list of name:port dictionaries.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

        GCE project ID
        [Default: (null)]

- service_account_email
        service account email
        [Default: (null)]

- size
        Size of Managed Instance Group.  If MIG already exists, it will be resized to the number provided here.  Required for creating
        MIGs.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        desired state of the resource
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]

- template
        Instance Template to be used in creating the VMs.  See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates to learn more
        about Instance Templates.  Required for creating MIGs.
        [Default: (null)]

= zone
        The GCE zone to use for this Managed Instance Group.



NOTES:
      * Resizing and Recreating VM are also supported.
      * An existing instance template is required in order to create a Managed Instance Group.

EXAMPLES:

# Following playbook creates, rebuilds instances, resizes and then deletes a MIG.
# Notes:
# - Two valid Instance Templates must exist in your GCE project in order to run
#   this playbook.  Change the fields to match the templates used in your
#   project.
# - The use of the 'pause' module is not required, it is just for convenience.
