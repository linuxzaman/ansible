> GCP_COMPUTE_INSTANCE_GROUP_MANAGER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gcp_compute_instance_group_manager.py)

        Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. After the group is created, it schedules
        an action to create instances in the group using the specified instance template. This operation is marked as DONE when the group
        is created even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the status of the individual
        instances. A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

= base_instance_name
        The base instance name to use for instances in this group. The value must be 1-58 characters long. Instances are named by
        appending a hyphen and a random four-character string to the base instance name.
        The base instance name must comply with RFC1035.


- description
        An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
        [Default: (null)]

= instance_template
        The instance template that is specified for this managed instance group. The group uses this template to create all new instances
        in the managed instance group.
        This field represents a link to a InstanceTemplate resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a
        dictionary with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_instance_template task and then set this instance_template field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"


= name
        The name of the managed instance group. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.

        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- target_pools
        TargetPool resources to which instances in the instanceGroup field are added. The target pools automatically apply to all of the
        instances in the managed instance group.
        [Default: (null)]

- target_size
        The target number of running instances for this managed instance group. Deleting or abandoning instances reduces this number.
        Resizing the group changes this number.
        [Default: (null)]

= zone
        The zone the managed instance group resides.



NOTES:
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_file using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the `GCP_AUTH_KIND' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set scopes using the `GCP_SCOPES' env variable.
      * Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
      * The `service_account_email' and `service_account_file' options are mutually exclusive.
