        Manage VLANs on a BIG-IP system

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- cmp_hash
        Specifies how the traffic on the VLAN will be disaggregated. The value selected determines the traffic disaggregation method. You
        can choose to disaggregate traffic based on `source-address' (the source IP address), `destination-address' (destination IP
        address), or `default', which specifies that the default CMP hash uses L4 ports.
        When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default of `default' is used.
        (Choices: default, destination-address, source-address, dst-ip, src-ip, dest, destination, source, dst, src)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

- dag_round_robin
        Specifies whether some of the stateless traffic on the VLAN should be disaggregated in a round-robin order instead of using a
        static hash. The stateless traffic includes non-IP L2 traffic, ICMP, some UDP protocols, and so on.
        When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default of (no) is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5
        

- dag_tunnel
        Specifies how the disaggregator (DAG) distributes received tunnel-encapsulated packets to TMM instances. Select `inner' to
        distribute packets based on information in inner headers. Select `outer' to distribute packets based on information in outer
        headers without inspecting inner headers.
        When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not specified, the default of `outer' is used.
        This parameter is not supported on Virtual Editions of BIG-IP.
        (Choices: inner, outer)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

- description
        The description to give to the VLAN.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- fail_safe
        When `yes', specifies that the VLAN takes the specified `fail_safe_action' if the system detects a loss of traffic on this VLAN's
        interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8
        

- fail_safe_action
        Specifies the action that the system takes when it does not detect any traffic on this VLAN, and the `fail_safe_timeout' has
        expired.
        (Choices: reboot, restart-all, failover)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8
        

- fail_safe_timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds that a system can run without detecting network traffic on this VLAN before it takes the
        `fail_safe_action'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.8
        

- interfaces
        Interfaces that you want added to the VLAN. This can include both tagged and untagged interfaces as the `tagging' parameter
        specifies.
        This parameter is mutually exclusive with the `untagged_interfaces' and `tagged_interfaces' parameters.

        type: list
        version_added: 2.8
        

- mtu
        Specifies the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for traffic on this VLAN. When creating a new VLAN, if this parameter is not
        specified, the default value used will be `1500'.
        This number must be between 576 to 9198.

NOTES:
      * Requires BIG-IP versions >= 12.0.0
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
