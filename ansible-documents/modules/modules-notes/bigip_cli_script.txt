        Manages CLI scripts on a BIG-IP. CLI scripts, otherwise known as tmshell scripts or TMSH scripts allow you to create custom
        scripts that can run to manage objects within a BIG-IP.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
