> NET_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/interface/net_interface.py)

        This module provides declarative management of Interfaces on network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of Interfaces definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- delay
        Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. This wait is applicable for operational state
        argument which are `state' with values `up'/`down', `tx_rate' and `rx_rate'.
        [Default: 10]

- description
        Description of Interface.
        [Default: (null)]

- duplex
        Interface link status
        (Choices: full, half, auto)[Default: auto]

- enabled
        Configure interface link status.
        [Default: (null)]

- mtu
        Maximum size of transmit packet.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the Interface.


- purge
        Purge Interfaces not defined in the aggregate parameter. This applies only for logical interface.
        [Default: False]

- rx_rate
        Receiver rate in bits per second (bps).
        This is state check parameter only.
        Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)
        [Default: (null)]

- speed
        Interface link speed.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the Interface configuration, `up' indicates present and operationally up and `down' indicates present and operationally
        `down'
        (Choices: present, absent, up, down)[Default: present]

- tx_rate
        Transmit rate in bits per second (bps).
        This is state check parameter only.
        Supports conditionals, see L(Conditionals in Networking Modules,../network/user_guide/network_working_with_command_output.html)
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * This module is supported on `ansible_network_os' network platforms. See the :ref:`Network Platform Options
        <platform_options>` for details.
