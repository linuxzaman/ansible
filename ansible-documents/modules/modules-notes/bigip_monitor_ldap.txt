        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- interval
        Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check when either the resource is down or the status
        of the resource is unknown.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
