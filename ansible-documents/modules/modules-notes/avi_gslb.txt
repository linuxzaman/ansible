        Cud operations on gslb, gslbservice, gslbgeodbprofile and other federated objects will be rejected.
        The rest-api disabling helps in upgrade scenarios where we don't want configuration sync operations to the gslb member when the
        member is being
        upgraded.

        upgrade.
