> BIGIP_DEVICE_GROUP_MEMBER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_group_member.py)

        Manages members in a device group. Members in a device group can only be added or removed, never updated. This is because the
        members are identified by unique name values and changing that name would invalidate the uniqueness.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= device_group
        The device group that you want to add the member to.

        type: str

= name
        Specifies the name of the device that you want to add to the device group. Often this will be the hostname of the device. This
        member must be trusted by the device already. Trusting can be done with the `bigip_device_trust' module and the `peer_hostname'
        option to that module.

        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
