> SLURP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/net_tools/basics/slurp.py)

        This module works like [fetch]. It is used for fetching a base64- encoded blob containing the data in a remote file. This module
        is also supported for Windows targets.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= src
        The file on the remote system to fetch. This `must' be a file, not a directory.
        (Aliases: path)
        type: path


NOTES:
      * This module returns an 'in memory' base64 encoded version of the file, take into account that this will require at least
        twice the RAM as the original file size.
      * This module is also supported for Windows targets.
