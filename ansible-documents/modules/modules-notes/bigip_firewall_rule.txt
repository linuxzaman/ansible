> BIGIP_FIREWALL_RULE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_firewall_rule.py)

        Manages firewall rules in an AFM firewall policy. New rules will always be added to the end of the policy. Rules can be re-
        ordered using the `bigip_security_policy' module. Rules can also be pre-ordered using the `bigip_security_policy' module and then
        later updated using the `bigip_firewall_rule' module.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- action
        Specifies the action for the firewall rule.
        When `accept', allows packets with the specified source, destination, and protocol to pass through the firewall. Packets that
        match the rule, and are accepted, traverse the system as if the firewall is not present.
        When `drop', drops packets with the specified source, destination, and protocol. Dropping a packet is a silent action with no
        notification to the source or destination systems. Dropping the packet causes the connection to be retried until the retry
        threshold is reached.
        When `reject', rejects packets with the specified source, destination, and protocol. When a packet is rejected the firewall sends
        a destination unreachable message to the sender.
        When `accept-decisively', allows packets with the specified source, destination, and protocol to pass through the firewall, and
        does not require any further processing by any of the further firewalls. Packets that match the rule, and are accepted, traverse
        the system as if the firewall is not present. If the Rule List is applied to a virtual server, management IP, or self IP firewall
        rule, then Accept Decisively is equivalent to Accept.
        When creating a new rule, if this parameter is not provided, the default is `reject'.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
