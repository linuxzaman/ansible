> PKGUTIL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/packaging/os/pkgutil.py)

        Manages CSW packages (SVR4 format) on Solaris 10 and 11. These were the native packages on Solaris <= 10 and are available as a
        legacy feature in Solaris 11. Pkgutil is an advanced packaging system, which resolves dependency on installation. It is designed
        for CSW packages.
