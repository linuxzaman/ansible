  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

        (Choices: ActivePassive, ALB, LACP)[Default: ActivePassive]

- bond_mode_1g
        Bond mode for 1GbE configuration.
        (Choices: ActivePassive, ALB, LACP)[Default: ActivePassive]

- dns_nameservers
        List of addresses for domain name servers.
        [Default: (null)]

- dns_search_domains
        List of DNS search domains.
        [Default: (null)]

= gateway_address_10g
        Router network address to send packets out of the local network.


= gateway_address_1g
        Router network address to send packets out of the local network.


= hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the SolidFire cluster.


= ip_address_10g
        IP address for the 10G network.


= ip_address_1g
        IP address for the 1G network.


- lacp_10g
        Link Aggregation Control Protocol useful only if LACP is selected as the Bond Mode.
        Slow - Packets are transmitted at 30 second intervals.
        Fast - Packets are transmitted in 1 second intervals.
        (Choices: Fast, Slow)[Default: Slow]

- lacp_1g
        Link Aggregation Control Protocol useful only if LACP is selected as the Bond Mode.
        Slow - Packets are transmitted at 30 second intervals.
        Fast - Packets are transmitted in 1 second intervals.
        (Choices: Fast, Slow)[Default: Slow]

= method
        Type of Method used to configure the interface.
        method depends on other settings such as the use of a static IP address, which will change the method to static.
        loopback - Used to define the IPv4 loopback interface.
        manual - Used to define interfaces for which no configuration is done by default.
        dhcp - May be used to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
        static - Used to define Ethernet interfaces with statically allocated IPv4 addresses.
        (Choices: loopback, manual, dhcp, static)

- mtu_10g
        Maximum Transmission Unit for 10GbE, Largest packet size that a network protocol can transmit.
        Must be greater than or equal to 1500 bytes.
        [Default: 1500]

- mtu_1g
        Maximum Transmission Unit for 1GbE, Largest packet size that a network protocol can transmit.
        Must be greater than or equal to 1500 bytes.
        [Default: 1500]

= password
        Password for the specified user.
        (Aliases: pass)

= subnet_10g
        10GbE Subnet Mask.


= subnet_1g
        1GbE Subnet Mask.


= username
        Please ensure that the user has the adequate permissions. For more information, please read the official documentation
        https://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/docweb/index.html?productID=62636&language=en-US.
        (Aliases: user)

- virtual_network_tag
        This is the primary network tag. All nodes in a cluster have the same VLAN tag.
        [Default: (null)]
