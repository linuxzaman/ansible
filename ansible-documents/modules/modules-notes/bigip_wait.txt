> BIGIP_WAIT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_wait.py)

        You can wait for BIG-IP to be "ready". By "ready", we mean that BIG-IP is ready to accept configuration. This module can take
        into account situations where the device is in the middle of rebooting due to a configuration change.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
