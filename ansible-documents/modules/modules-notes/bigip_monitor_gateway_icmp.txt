> BIGIP_MONITOR_GATEWAY_ICMP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_monitor_gateway_icmp.py)

        Manages gateway ICMP monitors on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- adaptive
        Specifies whether adaptive response time monitoring is enabled for this monitor.
        When `yes', the monitor determines the state of a service based on how divergent from the mean latency a monitor probe for that
        service is allowed to be. Also, values for the `allowed_divergence', `adaptive_limit', and and `sampling_timespan' will be
        enforced.
        When `disabled', the monitor determines the state of a service based on the `interval', `up_interval', `time_until_up', and
        `timeout' monitor settings.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- adaptive_limit
        Specifies the absolute number of milliseconds that may not be exceeded by a monitor probe, regardless of `allowed_divergence'
        setting, for a probe to be considered successful.
        This value applies regardless of the value of the `allowed_divergence' setting.
        While this value can be configured when `adaptive' is `no', it will not take effect on the system until `adaptive' is `yes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- allowed_divergence_type
        When specifying a new monitor, if `adaptive' is `yes', the default is `relative'
        When `absolute', the number of milliseconds the latency of a monitor probe can exceed the mean latency of a monitor probe for the
        service being probed. In typical cases, if the monitor detects three probes in a row that miss the latency value you set, the
        pool member or node is marked down.
        When `relative', the percentage of deviation the latency of a monitor probe can exceed the mean latency of a monitor probe for
        the service being probed.
        (Choices: relative, absolute)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- allowed_divergence_value
        When specifying a new monitor, if `adaptive' is `yes', and `type' is `relative', the default is `25' percent.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- description
        The description of the monitor.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- interval
        Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check when either the resource is down or the status
        of the resource is unknown.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value
        will be '*'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- manual_resume
        Specifies whether the system automatically changes the status of a resource to *enabled* at the next successful monitor check.
        If you set this option to `yes', you must manually re-enable the resource before the system can use it for load balancing
        connections.
        When `yes', specifies that you must manually re-enable the resource after an unsuccessful monitor check.
        When `no', specifies that the system automatically changes the status of a resource to *enabled* at the next successful monitor
        check.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        Monitor name.

        type: str

- parent
        The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the
        `gateway_icmp' parent on the `Common' partition.
        [Default: /Common/gateway_icmp]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

= password

        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- port
        Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified.

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for

              sites using self-signed certificates.

            type: bool
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.5

- sampling_timespan
        Specifies the length, in seconds, of the probe history window that the system uses to calculate the mean latency and standard
        deviation of a monitor probe.
        While this value can be configured when `adaptive' is `no', it will not take effect on the system until `adaptive' is `yes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- state
        When `present', ensures that the monitor exists.
        When `absent', ensures the monitor is removed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
        type: str

- time_until_up
        Specifies the number of seconds to wait after a resource first responds correctly to the monitor before setting the resource to
        'up'.
        During the interval, all responses from the resource must be correct.
        When the interval expires, the resource is marked 'up'.
        A value of 0, means that the resource is marked up immediately upon receipt of the first correct response.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request.
        If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered 'up'. If the target does not respond within the set time
        period, it is considered 'down'. When this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the interval from the parent monitor.
        Note that `timeout' and `time_until_up' combine to control when a resource is set to up.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- transparent
        Specifies whether the monitor operates in transparent mode.
        A monitor in transparent mode directs traffic through the associated pool members or nodes (usually a router or firewall) to the
        aliased destination (that is, it probes the `ip'-`port' combination specified in the monitor).
        If the monitor cannot successfully reach the aliased destination, the pool member or node through which the monitor traffic was
        sent is marked down.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be whatever is provided by the
        `parent'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- up_interval
        Specifies the interval for the system to use to perform the health check when a resource is up.
        When `0', specifies that the system uses the interval specified in `interval' to check the health of the resource.
        When any other number, enables specification of a different interval to use when checking the health of a resource that is up.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
