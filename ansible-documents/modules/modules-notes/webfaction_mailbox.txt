> WEBFACTION_MAILBOX    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/webfaction/webfaction_mailbox.py)

        Add or remove mailboxes on a Webfaction account. Further documentation at https://github.com/quentinsf/ansible-webfaction.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= login_name
        The webfaction account to use


= login_password
        The webfaction password to use


= mailbox_name
        The name of the mailbox


= mailbox_password
        The password for the mailbox


- state
        Whether the mailbox should exist
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the
        remote webfaction API. The location is not important. However, running them on multiple hosts `simultaneously' is best
        avoided. If you don't specify `localhost' as your host, you may want to add `serial: 1' to the plays.
      * See `the webfaction API <https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/>`_ for more info.
