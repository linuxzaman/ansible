        This is the To field in the UCS Manager Add WWN Blocks menu.
        For WWxN pools, the pool size must be a multiple of ports-per-node + 1.
        For example, if there are 7 ports per node, the pool size must be a multiple of 8.
        If there are 63 ports per node, the pool size must be a multiple of 64.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        The name of the World Wide Node Name (WWNN) or World Wide Port Name (WWPN) pool.

        This can be one of the following:
        default - Cisco UCS Manager selects a random identity from the pool.
        sequential - Cisco UCS Manager selects the lowest available identity from the pool.

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= purpose
        Specify whether this is a node (WWNN) or port (WWPN) pool.
        Optional if state is absent.
        (Choices: node, port)

- state
        If `present', will verify WWNNs/WWPNs are present and will create if needed.
        If `absent', will verify WWNNs/WWPNs are absent and will delete if needed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- use_proxy
        If `no', will not use the proxy as defined by system environment variable.
        [Default: True]
