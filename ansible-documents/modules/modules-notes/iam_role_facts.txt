        Gathers information about IAM roles

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- name
        Name of a role to search for
        Mutually exclusive with `prefix'
        (Aliases: role_name)[Default: (null)]

- path_prefix
        Prefix of role `path' to restrict IAM role search for
        Mutually exclusive with `name'
        [Default: (null)]

- profile
        Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- region
        The AWS region to use. If not specified then the value of the AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION environment variable, if any, is used. See
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region
        (Aliases: aws_region, ec2_region)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- security_token
        AWS STS security token. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable is used.
        (Aliases: access_token)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- validate_certs
        When set to "no", SSL certificates will not be validated for boto versions >= 2.6.0.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.5


NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  boto, boto3, python >= 2.6
