> FLATPAK_REMOTE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/packaging/os/flatpak_remote.py)

        Allows users to add or remove flatpak remotes. The flatpak remotes concept is comparable to what is called repositories in other
        packaging formats. Currently, remote addition is only supported via `flatpakrepo' file URLs. Existing remotes will not be
        updated. See the [flatpak] module for managing flatpaks.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- executable
        The path to the `flatpak' executable to use.
        By default, this module looks for the `flatpak' executable on the path.
        [Default: flatpak]

- flatpakrepo_url
        The URL to the `flatpakrepo' file representing the repository remote to add.
        When used with `state=present', the flatpak remote specified under the `flatpakrepo_url' is added using the specified
        installation `method'.
        When used with `state=absent', this is not required.
        Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- method
        The installation method to use.
        Defines if the `flatpak' is supposed to be installed globally for the whole `system' or only for the current `user'.
        (Choices: system, user)[Default: system]

= name
        The desired name for the flatpak remote to be registered under on the managed host.
        When used with `state=present', the remote will be added to the managed host under the specified `name'.
        When used with `state=absent' the remote with that name will be removed.


- state
        Indicates the desired package state.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
