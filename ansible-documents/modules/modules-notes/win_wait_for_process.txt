> WIN_WAIT_FOR_PROCESS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_wait_for_process.py)

        Waiting for a process to start or stop. This is useful when Windows services behave poorly and do not enumerate external
        dependencies in their manifest.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- owner
        The owner of the process.
        Requires PowerShell version 4.0 or newer.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- pid
        The PID of the process.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- post_wait_delay
        Seconds to wait after checking for processes.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int

- pre_wait_delay
        Seconds to wait before checking processes.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int

- process_min_count
        Minimum number of process matching the supplied pattern to satisfy `present' condition.
        Only applies to `present'.
        [Default: 1]
        type: int

- process_name_exact
        The name of the process(es) for which to wait.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- process_name_pattern
        RegEx pattern matching desired process(es).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- sleep
        Number of seconds to sleep between checks.
        Only applies when waiting for a process to start.  Waiting for a process to start does not have a native non-polling mechanism.
        Waiting for a stop uses native PowerShell and does not require polling.
        [Default: 1]
        type: int

- state
        When checking for a running process `present' will block execution until the process exists, or until the timeout has been
        reached. `absent' will block execution untile the processs no longer exists, or until the timeout has been reached.
        When waiting for `present', the module will return changed only if the process was not present on the initial check but became
        present on subsequent checks.
        If, while waiting for `absent', new processes matching the supplied pattern are started, these new processes will not be included
        in the action.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- timeout
        The maximum number of seconds to wait for a for a process to start or stop before erroring out.
        [Default: 300]
        type: int
