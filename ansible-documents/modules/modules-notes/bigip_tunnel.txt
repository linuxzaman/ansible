> BIGIP_TUNNEL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_tunnel.py)

        Manages tunnels on a BIG-IP. Tunnels are usually based upon a tunnel profile which defines both default arguments and constraints
        for the tunnel. Due to this, this module exposes a number of settings that may or may not be related to the type of tunnel you
        are working with. It is important that you take this into consideration when declaring your tunnel config. If a specific tunnel
        does not support the parameter you are considering, the documentation of the parameter will usually make mention of this.
        Otherwise, when configuring that parameter on the device, the device will notify you.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auto_last_hop
        Allows you to configure auto last hop on a per-tunnel basis.
        When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default is `default'.
        When `default', means that the system uses the global auto-lasthop setting to send back the request.
        When `enabled', allows the system to send return traffic to the MAC address that transmitted the request, even if the routing
        table points to a different network or interface. As a result, the system can send return traffic to clients even when there is
        no matching route.
        (Choices: default, enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- description
        Description of the tunnel.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- key
        When applied to a GRE tunnel, this value specifies an optional field in the GRE header, used to authenticate the source of the
        packet.
        When applied to a VXLAN or Geneve tunnel, this value specifies the Virtual Network Identifier (VNI).
        When applied to an NVGRE tunnel, this value specifies the Virtual Subnet Identifier (VSID).
        When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default value is `0'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- local_address
        Specifies the IP address of the local endpoint of the tunnel.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- mode
        Specifies how the tunnel carries traffic.
        When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default is
        `bidirectional'.
        When `bidirectional', specifies that the tunnel carries both inbound and outbound traffic.
        When `inbound', specifies that the tunnel carries only incoming traffic.
        When `outbound', specifies that the tunnel carries only outgoing traffic.
        (Choices: bidirectional, inbound, outbound)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- mtu
        Specifies the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the tunnel.
        When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default value is `0'.
        The valid range is from `0' to `65515'.
        [Default: (null)]

        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- profile
        Specifies the profile to associate with the tunnel for handling traffic.
        Depending on your selection, other settings become available or disappear.
        This parameter may not be changed after it is set.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for

            type: bool
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.5

- remote_address
        Specifies the IP address of the remote endpoint of the tunnel.
        For `dslite', `fec' (when configuring the FEC tunnel for receiving traffic only), `v6rd' (configured as a border relay), or
        `map', the tunnel must have an unspecified remote address (any).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- secondary_address
        Specifies a non-floating IP address for the tunnel, to be used with host-initiated traffic.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- state
        When `present', ensures that the tunnel exists.
        When `absent', ensures the tunnel is removed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
        type: str

- tos
        Specifies the Type of Service (TOS) value to insert in the encapsulating header of transmitted packets.
        When creating a new tunnel, if this parameter is supported by the tunnel profile but not specified, the default value is
        `preserve'.
        When `preserve', the system copies the TOS value from the inner header to the outer header.
        You may also specify a numeric value. The possible values are from `0' to `255'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- traffic_group
        Specifies the traffic group to associate with the tunnel.
        This value cannot be changed after it is set. This is a limitation of BIG-IP.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- transparent
        Specifies that the tunnel operates in transparent mode.
        When `yes', you can inspect and manipulate the encapsulated traffic flowing through the BIG-IP system.
        A transparent tunnel terminates a tunnel while presenting the illusion that the tunnel transits the device unmodified (that is,
        the BIG-IP system appears as if it were an intermediate router that simply routes IP traffic through the device).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- use_pmtu
        Enables or disables the tunnel to use the PMTU (Path MTU) information provided by ICMP NeedFrag error messages.
        If `yes' and the tunnel `mtu' is set to `0', the tunnel will use the PMTU information.
        If `yes' and the tunnel `mtu' is fixed to a non-zero value, the tunnel will use the minimum of PMTU and MTU.
        If `no', the tunnel will use fixed MTU or calculate its MTU using tunnel encapsulation configurations.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
