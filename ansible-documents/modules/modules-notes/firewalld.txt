> FIREWALLD    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/firewalld.py)

        This module allows for addition or deletion of services and ports (either TCP or UDP) in either running or permanent firewalld
        rules.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- icmp_block
        The ICMP block you would like to add/remove to/from a zone in firewalld.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8

- icmp_block_inversion
        Enable/Disable inversion of ICMP blocks for a zone in firewalld.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8

- immediate
        Should this configuration be applied immediately, if set as permanent.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.9

- interface
        The interface you would like to add/remove to/from a zone in firewalld.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.1

- masquerade
        The masquerade setting you would like to enable/disable to/from zones within firewalld.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.1

- offline
        Whether to run this module even when firewalld is offline.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.3

- permanent
        Should this configuration be in the running firewalld configuration or persist across reboots.
        As of Ansible 2.3, permanent operations can operate on firewalld configs when it is not running (requires firewalld >= 3.0.9).
        Note that if this is `no', immediate is assumed `yes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- port
        Name of a port or port range to add/remove to/from firewalld.
        Must be in the form PORT/PROTOCOL or PORT-PORT/PROTOCOL for port ranges.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- rich_rule
        Rich rule to add/remove to/from firewalld.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service
        Name of a service to add/remove to/from firewalld.
        The service must be listed in output of firewall-cmd --get-services.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- source
        The source/network you would like to add/remove to/from firewalld.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.0

= state
        Enable or disable a setting.
        For ports: Should this port accept (enabled) or reject (disabled) connections.
        The states `present' and `absent' can only be used in zone level operations (i.e. when no other parameters but zone and state are
        set).
        (Choices: absent, disabled, enabled, present)
        type: str

- timeout
        The amount of time the rule should be in effect for when non-permanent.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int

- zone
        The firewalld zone to add/remove to/from.
        Note that the default zone can be configured per system but `public' is default from upstream.
        Available choices can be extended based on per-system configs, listed here are "out of the box" defaults.
        Possible values include `block', `dmz', `drop', `external', `home', `internal', `public', `trusted', `work'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * Not tested on any Debian based system.
      * Requires the python2 bindings of firewalld, which may not be installed by default.
      * For distributions where the python2 firewalld bindings are unavailable (e.g Fedora 28 and later) you will have to set the
        ansible_python_interpreter for these hosts to the python3 interpreter path and install the python3 bindings.
      * Zone transactions (creating, deleting) can be performed by using only the zone and state parameters "present" or "absent".
        Note that zone transactions must explicitly be permanent. This is a limitation in firewalld. This also means that you will
        have to reload firewalld after adding a zone that you wish to perform immediate actions on. The module will not take care
        of this for you implicitly because that would undo any previously performed immediate actions which were not permanent.
        Therefore, if you require immediate access to a newly created zone it is recommended you reload firewalld immediately after
        the zone creation returns with a changed state and before you perform any other immediate, non-permanent actions on that
        zone.


REQUIREMENTS:  firewalld >= 0.2.11
