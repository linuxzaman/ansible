        Create, Update or Destory a Url_Map. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/url-map for an overview. More
        details on the Url_Map API can be found at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/urlMaps#resource.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Updated modules released with increased functionality
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use M(gcp_compute_url_map) instead.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= default_service
        Default Backend Service if no host rules match.


- host_rules
        The list of HostRules to use against the URL. Contains a list of hosts and an associated path_matcher.
        The 'hosts' parameter is a list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames, except * will match any string of
        ([a-z0-9-.]*). In that case, * must be the first character and must be followed in the pattern by either - or ..
        The 'path_matcher' parameter is name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of the URL if the hostRule matches the
        URL's host portion.
        [Default: (null)]

- path_matchers
        The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL. Contains path_rules, which is a list of paths and an associated service. A
        default_service can also be specified for each path_matcher.
        The 'name' parameter to which this path_matcher is referred by the host_rule.
        The 'default_service' parameter is the name of the BackendService resource. This will be used if none of the path_rules defined
        by this path_matcher is matched by the URL's path portion.
        The 'path_rules' parameter is a list of dictionaries containing a list of paths and a service to direct traffic to. Each path
        item must start with / and the only place a * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the path matcher does not
        include any text after the first ? or
        [Default: (null)]

= url_map_name
        Name of the Url_Map.



NOTES:
      * Only supports global Backend Services.
      * Url_Map tests are not currently supported.
