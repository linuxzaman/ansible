> GATHER_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/gather_facts.py)

        This module takes care of executing the configured facts modules, the default is to use the [setup] module. This module is
        automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. It can also be
        executed directly by `/usr/bin/ansible' to check what variables are available to a host. Ansible provides many `facts' about the
        system, automatically.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- parallel
        A toggle that controls if the fact modules are executed in parallel or serially and in order. This can guarantee the merge order
        of module facts at the expense of performance.
        By default it will be true if more than one fact module is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * This module is mostly a wrapper around other fact gathering modules.
      * Options passed to this module must be supported by all the underlying fact modules configured.
      * Facts returned by each module will be merged, conflicts will favor 'last merged'. Order is not guaranteed, when doing
        parallel gathering on multiple modules.
