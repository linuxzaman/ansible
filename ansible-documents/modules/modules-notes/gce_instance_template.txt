        type: bool

- credentials_file
        path to the JSON file associated with the service account email
        [Default: (null)]

        [Default: (null)]

- network
        The network to associate with the instance.
        [Default: default]

- nic_gce_struct
        Support passing in the GCE-specific formatted networkInterfaces[] structure.
        [Default: (null)]

- pem_file
        path to the pem file associated with the service account email This option is deprecated. Use 'credentials_file'.
        [Default: (null)]

- preemptible
        Defines whether the instance is preemptible.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- project_id
        your GCE project ID
        [Default: (null)]

        service account email
        [Default: (null)]

- service_account_permissions
        service account permissions (see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create, --scopes section for
        detailed information)
        (Choices: bigquery, cloud-platform, compute-ro, compute-rw, useraccounts-ro, useraccounts-rw, datastore, logging-write,
        monitoring, sql-admin, storage-full, storage-ro, storage-rw, taskqueue, userinfo-email)[Default: (null)]

- size
        The desired machine type for the instance template.
        [Default: f1-micro]

- source
        A source disk to attach to the instance. Cannot specify both `image' and `source'.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        The desired state for the instance template.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subnetwork
        The Subnetwork resource name for this instance.
        [Default: (null)]

- subnetwork_region
        Region that subnetwork resides in. (Required for subnetwork to successfully complete)
        [Default: (null)]
