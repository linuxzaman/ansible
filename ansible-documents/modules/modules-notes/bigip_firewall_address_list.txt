> BIGIP_FIREWALL_ADDRESS_LIST    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_firewall_address_list.py)

        Manages the AFM address lists on a BIG-IP. This module can be used to add and remove address list entries.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address_lists
        Simple list of existing address lists to add to this list. Address lists can be specified in either their fully qualified name
        (/Common/foo) or their short name (foo). If a short name is used, the `partition' argument will automatically be prepended to the
        short name.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- address_ranges
        A list of address ranges where the range starts with a port number, is followed by a dash (-) and then a second number.
        If the first address is greater than the second number, the numbers will be reversed so-as to be properly formatted. ie,
        `2.2.2.2-1.1.1'. would become `1.1.1.1-2.2.2.2'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- addresses
        Individual addresses that you want to add to the list. These addresses differ from ranges, and lists of lists such as what can be
        used in `address_ranges' and `address_lists' respectively.
        This list can also include networks that have CIDR notation.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- description
        Description of the address list
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- fqdns
        A list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
        An FQDN has at least one decimal point in it, separating the host from the domain.
        To add FQDNs to a list requires that a global FQDN resolver be configured. At the moment, this must either be done via
        `bigip_command', or, in the GUI of BIG-IP. If using `bigip_command', this can be done with `tmsh modify security firewall global-
        fqdn-policy FOO' where `FOO' is a DNS resolver configured at `tmsh create net dns-resolver FOO'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
