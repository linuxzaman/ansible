- fetch_nested
        If `True' the module will fetch additional data from the API.
        It will fetch IDs of the VMs disks, snapshots, etc. User can configure to fetch other attributes of the nested entities by

= name
        Name of the MAC pool to manage.

EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Create MAC pool:
- ovirt_mac_pool:
    name: mymacpool
    allow_duplicates: false
    ranges:
      - 00:1a:4a:16:01:51,00:1a:4a:16:01:61
      - 00:1a:4a:16:02:51,00:1a:4a:16:02:61

# Remove MAC pool:
- ovirt_mac_pool:
    state: absent
    name: mymacpool

# Change MAC pool Name
- ovirt_nic:
    id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    name: "new_mac_pool_name"
