> BIGIP_GTM_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/_bigip_gtm_facts.py)

        Collect facts from F5 BIG-IP GTM devices.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: The bigip_gtm_facts module is an outlier as all facts are being collected in the bigip_device_facts module. Additionally, the M(bigip_device_facts) module is easier to maintain and use.

	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.11
	Alternatives: bigip_device_facts

NOTES:
      * This module is deprecated. Use the `bigip_device_facts' module instead.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
