- create_copy_pair_if_does_not_exist
        Defines if a copy pair will be created if it does not exist.
        If set to True destination_volume_id and source_volume_id are required.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- destination_volume_id
        The id of the volume copy destination.
        If used, must be paired with source_volume_id
        Mutually exclusive with volume_copy_pair_id, and search_volume_id
        [Default: (null)]

- search_volume_id
        Searches for all valid potential target and source volumes that could be used in a copy_pair
        Mutually exclusive with volume_copy_pair_id, destination_volume_id and source_volume_id
        [Default: (null)]

- source_volume_id
        The id of the volume copy source.
        If used, must be paired with destination_volume_id
        Mutually exclusive with volume_copy_pair_id, and search_volume_id
        [Default: (null)]

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- start_stop_copy
        starts a re-copy or stops a copy in progress
        Note: If you stop the initial file copy before it it done the copy pair will be destroyed
        Requires volume_copy_pair_id
        [Default: (null)]

= state
        Whether the specified volume copy pair should exist or not.
        (Choices: present, absent)

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- volume_copy_pair_id
        The id of a given volume copy pair
        Mutually exclusive with destination_volume_id, source_volume_id, and search_volume_id
        Can use to delete or check presence of volume pairs
        Must specify this or (destination_volume_id and source_volume_id)
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
