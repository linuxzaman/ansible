> EDGEOS_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/edgeos/edgeos_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running EdgeOS. This module prepends all of the base network
        fact keys with ansible_net_<fact>. The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or
        disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all,
        default, config, and neighbors. Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial
        `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: !config]


NOTES:
      * Tested against EdgeOS 1.9.7
