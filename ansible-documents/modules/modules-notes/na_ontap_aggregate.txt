        Create, delete, or manage aggregates on ONTAP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- disk_count
        Number of disks to place into the aggregate, including parity disks.
        The disks in this newly-created aggregate come from the spare disk pool.
        The smallest disks in this pool join the aggregate first, unless the `disk-size' argument is provided.
        Either `disk-count' or `disks' must be supplied. Range [0..2^31-1].
        Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- disk_size
        Disk size to use in 4K block size.  Disks within 10% of specified size will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7

- disk_type
        Type of disk to use to build aggregate
        (Choices: ATA, BSAS, FCAL, FSAS, LUN, MSATA, SAS, SSD, VMDISK)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7

- disks
        Specific list of disks to use for the new aggregate.
        To create a "mirrored" aggregate with a specific list of disks, both 'disks' and 'mirror_disks' options must be supplied.
        Additionally, the same number of disks must be supplied in both lists.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.8

- from_name
        Name of the aggregate to be renamed.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7

= hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the ONTAP instance.

        type: str

        Override the default port (80 or 443) with this port
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- https
        Enable and disable https
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- is_mirrored
        Specifies that the new aggregate be mirrored (have two plexes).
        If set to true, then the indicated disks will be split across the two plexes. By default, the new aggregate will not be mirrored.
        This option cannot be used when a specific list of disks is supplied with either the 'disks' or 'mirror_disks' options.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- mirror_disks
        List of mirror disks to use. It must contain the same number of disks specified in 'disks'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.8

= name
        The name of the aggregate to manage.


- nodes
        Node(s) for the aggregate to be created on.  If no node specified, mgmt lif home will be used.
        If multiple nodes specified an aggr stripe will be made.
        [Default: (null)]

- ontapi
        The ontap api version to use
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

        version_added: 2.7

- service_state
        Whether the specified aggregate should be enabled or disabled. Creates aggregate if doesnt exist.
        (Choices: online, offline)[Default: (null)]

- spare_pool
        Specifies the spare pool from which to select spare disks to use in creation of a new aggregate.
        (Choices: Pool0, Pool1)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8

- state
        Whether the specified aggregate should exist or not.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- time_out
        time to wait for aggregate creation in seconds
        default is set to 100 seconds
        [Default: 100]
        version_added: 2.8

- unmount_volumes
        If set to "TRUE", this option specifies that all of the volumes hosted by the given aggregate are to be unmounted
        before the offline operation is executed.
        By default, the system will reject any attempt to offline an aggregate that hosts one or more online volumes.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= username
        This can be a Cluster-scoped or SVM-scoped account, depending on whether a Cluster-level or SVM-level API is required. For more

        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- wait_for_online
        Set this parameter to 'true' for synchronous execution during create (wait until aggregate status is online)
        Set this parameter to 'false' for asynchronous execution
        For asynchronous, execution exits as soon as the request is sent, without checking aggregate status
        [Default: False]

NOTES:
      * The modules prefixed with na\\_ontap are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.


REQUIREMENTS:  A physical or virtual clustered Data ONTAP system. The modules support Data ONTAP 9.1 and onward, Ansible 2.6, Python2
        netapp-lib (2017.10.30) or later. Install using 'pip install netapp-lib', Python3 netapp-lib (2018.11.13) or
        later. Install using 'pip install netapp-lib', To enable http on the cluster you must run the following commands
        'set -privilege advanced;' 'system services web modify -http-enabled true;'
