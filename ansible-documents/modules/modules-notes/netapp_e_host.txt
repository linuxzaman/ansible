  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- force_port
        Allow ports that are already assigned to be re-assigned to your current host
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7
        

- group
        The unique identifier of the host-group you want the host to be a member of; this is used for clustering.
        (Aliases: cluster)[Default: (null)]

- host_type_index
        The index that maps to host type you wish to create. It is recommended to use the [netapp_e_facts] module to gather this
        information. Alternatively you can use the WSP portal to retrieve the information.
        Required when `state=present'
        (Aliases: host_type)[Default: (null)]

- log_path
        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7
        

= name
        If the host doesn't yet exist, the label/name to assign at creation time.
        If the hosts already exists, this will be used to uniquely identify the host to make any required changes
        (Aliases: label)

- ports
        A list of host ports you wish to associate with the host.
        Host ports are uniquely identified by their WWN or IQN. Their assignments to a particular host are uniquely identified by a label
        and these must be unique.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          label:
            description:
            - A unique label to assign to this port assignment.
            required: true
          port:
            description:
            - The WWN or IQN of the hostPort to assign to this port definition.
            required: true
          type:
            choices:
            - iscsi
            - sas
            - fc
            - ib
            - nvmeof
            - ethernet
            description:
            - The interface type of the port to define.
            - Acceptable choices depend on the capabilities of the target hardware/software
              platform.
            required: true
        

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- state
        Set to absent to remove an existing host
        Set to present to modify or create a new host definition
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        version_added: 2.7
        

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
