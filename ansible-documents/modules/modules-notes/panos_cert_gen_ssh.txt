> PANOS_CERT_GEN_SSH    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/panos/_panos_cert_gen_ssh.py)

        This module generates a self-signed certificate that can be used by GlobalProtect client, SSL connector, or otherwise. Root
        certificate must be preset on the system first. This module depends on paramiko for ssh.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Consolidating code base.
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use U(https://galaxy.ansible.com/PaloAltoNetworks/paloaltonetworks) instead.
