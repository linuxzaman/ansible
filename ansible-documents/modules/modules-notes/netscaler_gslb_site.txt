> NETSCALER_GSLB_SITE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/netscaler/netscaler_gslb_site.py)

        Manage gslb site entities in Netscaler.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- clip
        Cluster IP address. Specify this parameter to connect to the remote cluster site for GSLB auto-sync. Note: The cluster IP address
        is defined when creating the cluster.
        [Default: (null)]

- metricexchange
        Exchange metrics with other sites. Metrics are exchanged by using Metric Exchange Protocol (MEP). The appliances in the GSLB
        setup exchange health information once every second.
        If you disable metrics exchange, you can use only static load balancing methods (such as round robin, static proximity, or the
        hash-based methods), and if you disable metrics exchange when a dynamic load balancing method (such as least connection) is in
        operation, the appliance falls back to round robin. Also, if you disable metrics exchange, you must use a monitor to determine
        the state of GSLB services. Otherwise, the service is marked as DOWN.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- naptrreplacementsuffix
        The naptr replacement suffix configured here will be used to construct the naptr replacement field in NAPTR record.
        Minimum length = 1
        [Default: (null)]

= nitro_pass
        The password with which to authenticate to the netscaler node.

        type: str

- nitro_protocol
        Which protocol to use when accessing the nitro API objects.
        (Choices: http, https)[Default: http]
        type: str

- nitro_timeout
        Time in seconds until a timeout error is thrown when establishing a new session with Netscaler
        [Default: 310]
        type: float

= nitro_user
        The username with which to authenticate to the netscaler node.

        type: str

= nsip
        The ip address of the netscaler appliance where the nitro API calls will be made.
        The port can be specified with the colon (:). E.g. 192.168.1.1:555.

        type: str

- nwmetricexchange
        Exchange, with other GSLB sites, network metrics such as round-trip time (RTT), learned from communications with various local
        DNS (LDNS) servers used by clients. RTT information is used in the dynamic RTT load balancing method, and is exchanged every 5
        seconds.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- parentsite
        Parent site of the GSLB site, in a parent-child topology.
        [Default: (null)]

- publicclip
        IP address to be used to globally access the remote cluster when it is deployed behind a NAT. It can be same as the normal
        cluster IP address.
        [Default: (null)]

- publicip
        Public IP address for the local site. Required only if the appliance is deployed in a private address space and the site has a
        public IP address hosted on an external firewall or a NAT device.
        Minimum length = 1
        [Default: (null)]

- save_config
        If `yes' the module will save the configuration on the netscaler node if it makes any changes.
        The module will not save the configuration on the netscaler node if it made no changes.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- sessionexchange
        Exchange persistent session entries with other GSLB sites every five seconds.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- siteipaddress
        IP address for the GSLB site. The GSLB site uses this IP address to communicate with other GSLB sites. For a local site, use any
        IP address that is owned by the appliance (for example, a SNIP or MIP address, or the IP address of the ADNS service).
        Minimum length = 1
        [Default: (null)]

- sitename
        Name for the GSLB site. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore `_' character, and must contain only ASCII
        alphanumeric, underscore `_', hash `#', period `.', space ` ', colon `:', at `@', equals `=', and hyphen `-' characters. Cannot
        be changed after the virtual server is created.
        Minimum length = 1
        [Default: (null)]

- sitetype
        Type of site to create. If the type is not specified, the appliance automatically detects and sets the type on the basis of the
        IP address being assigned to the site. If the specified site IP address is owned by the appliance (for example, a MIP address or
        SNIP address), the site is a local site. Otherwise, it is a remote site.
        (Choices: REMOTE, LOCAL)[Default: (null)]

- state
        The state of the resource being configured by the module on the netscaler node.
        When present the resource will be created if needed and configured according to the module's parameters.
        When absent the resource will be deleted from the netscaler node.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- triggermonitor
        Specify the conditions under which the GSLB service must be monitored by a monitor, if one is bound. Available settings function
        as follows:
        * `ALWAYS' - Monitor the GSLB service at all times.
        * `MEPDOWN' - Monitor the GSLB service only when the exchange of metrics through the Metrics Exchange Protocol (MEP) is disabled.
        `MEPDOWN_SVCDOWN' - Monitor the service in either of the following situations:
        * The exchange of metrics through MEP is disabled.
        * The exchange of metrics through MEP is enabled but the status of the service, learned through metrics exchange, is DOWN.
        (Choices: ALWAYS, MEPDOWN, MEPDOWN_SVCDOWN)[Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
        certificates.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
