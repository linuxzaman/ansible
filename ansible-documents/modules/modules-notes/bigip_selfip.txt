        Manage Self-IPs on a BIG-IP system.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        The IP addresses for the new self IP. This value is ignored upon update as addresses themselves cannot be changed after they are
        created.
        This value is required when creating new self IPs.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- allow_service
        Configure port lockdown for the Self IP. By default, the Self IP has a "default deny" policy. This can be changed to allow TCP
        and UDP ports as well as specific protocols. This list should contain `protocol':`port' values.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- description
        Description of the traffic selector.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8
        

= name
        The self IP to create.
        If this parameter is not specified, then it will default to the value supplied in the `address' parameter.

        type: str

- netmask
        The netmask for the self IP. When creating a new Self IP, this value is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on. You can set different partitions for Self IPs, but the address used may not match any
        other address used by a Self IP. In that sense, Self IPs are not isolated by partitions as other resources on a BIG-IP are.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
