        When the hypervisor name is specified the newly created disk or an existing disk will refresh its information about the
        underlying storage( Disk size, Serial, Product ID, Vendor ID ...) The specified host will be used for gathering the storage

        Note that this option isn't idempotent as it's not currently possible to change sparseness of the disk via API.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5

- sparsify
        `True' if the disk should be sparsified.
        Sparsification frees space in the disk image that is not used by its filesystem. As a result, the image will occupy less space on
        the storage.
        Note that this parameter isn't idempotent, as it's not possible to check if the disk should be or should not be sparsified.
        [Default: (null)]

        [Default: (null)]

- storage_domains
        Storage domain names where disk should be copied.
        `**IMPORTANT**'
        There is no reliable way to achieve idempotency, so every time you specify this parameter the disks are copied, so please handle
        your playbook accordingly to not copy the disks all the time. This is valid only for VM and floating disks, template disks works
        as expected.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

- timeout
        The amount of time in seconds the module should wait for the instance to get into desired state.
        [Default: 180]
        type: int

        Path to disk image, which should be uploaded.
        Note that currently we support only compatibility version 0.10 of the qcow disk.
        Note that you must have an valid oVirt/RHV engine CA in your system trust store or you must provide it in `ca_file' parameter.
        Note that there is no reliable way to achieve idempotency, so if you want to upload the disk even if the disk with `id' or `name'
        exists, then please use `force' `true'. If you will use `force' `false', which is default, then the disk image won't be uploaded.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

        ID of the Virtual Machine to manage. Either `vm_id' or `vm_name' is required if `state' is `attached' or `detached'.
        [Default: (null)]

- vm_name
        Name of the Virtual Machine to manage. Either `vm_id' or `vm_name' is required if `state' is `attached' or `detached'.
        [Default: (null)]
