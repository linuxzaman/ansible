> OVH_IP_FAILOVER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/ovh/ovh_ip_failover.py)

        Manage OVH (French European hosting provider) IP Failover Address. For now, this module can only be used to move an ip failover
        (or failover block) between services

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= application_key
        The applicationKey to use


= application_secret
        The application secret to use


= consumer_key
        The consumer key to use


= endpoint
        The endpoint to use ( for instance ovh-eu)


= name
        The IP address to manage (can be a single IP like 1.1.1.1 or a block like 1.1.1.1/28 )


= service
        The name of the OVH service this IP address should be routed


- timeout
        The timeout in seconds used to wait for a task to be completed. Default is 120 seconds.
        [Default: 120]

- wait_completion
        If true, the module will wait for the IP address to be moved. If false, exit without waiting. The taskId will be returned in
        module output
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- wait_task_completion
        If not 0, the module will wait for this task id to be completed. Use wait_task_completion if you want to wait for completion of a
        previously executed task with wait_completion=false. You can execute this module repeatedly on a list of failover IPs using
        wait_completion=false (see examples)
        [Default: 0]


NOTES:
      * Uses the python OVH Api https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh. You have to create an application (a key and secret) with a
        consummer key as described into https://eu.api.ovh.com/g934.first_step_with_api


REQUIREMENTS:  ovh >=  0.4.8
