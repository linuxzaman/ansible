> DELLOS10_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/dellos10/dellos10_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running OS10.  This module prepends all of the base network fact
        keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or
        disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        hardware, config, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with an
        initial `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: [u'!config']]

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]

            - Password to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str

            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.

          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Path to an ssh key used to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device.  If
              the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
