OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= datacenter
        Name of the datacenter.


- folder
        Destination folder, absolute or relative path to find an existing guest.
        This is required only, if multiple virtual machines with same name are found on given vCenter.
        The folder should include the datacenter. ESX's datacenter is ha-datacenter
        Examples:
           folder: /ha-datacenter/vm
           folder: ha-datacenter/vm
           folder: /datacenter1/vm
           folder: datacenter1/vm
           folder: /datacenter1/vm/folder1
           folder: datacenter1/vm/folder1
           folder: /folder1/datacenter1/vm
           folder: folder1/datacenter1/vm
           folder: /folder1/datacenter1/vm/folder2
        [Default: (null)]

- hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_HOST' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- name
        Name of the VM to work with.
        This is required if `uuid' is not supplied.
        [Default: (null)]

- password
        The password of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PASSWORD' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- port
        The port number of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PORT' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.5

- use_instance_uuid
        Whether to use the VMWare instance UUID rather than the BIOS UUID.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- username
        The username of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_USER' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: admin, user)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- uuid
        UUID of the instance to manage if known, this is VMware's BIOS UUID by default.
        This is required if `name' parameter is not supplied.
        The `folder' is ignored, if `uuid' is provided.
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to `false' when certificates are not trusted.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_VALIDATE_CERTS' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
