        Manages a VPC network or legacy network resource on GCP.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- auto_create_subnetworks
        When set to `true`, the network is created in "auto subnet mode" and it will create a subnet for each region automatically across
        the `10.128.0.0/9` address range.
        When set to `false`, the network is created in "custom subnet mode" so the user can explicitly connect subnetwork resources.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- description
        An optional description of this resource. The resource must be recreated to modify this field.
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv4_range
        If this field is specified, a deprecated legacy network is created.
        You will no longer be able to create a legacy network on Feb 1, 2020.
        See the [legacy network docs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/legacy) for more details.
        The range of internal addresses that are legal on this legacy network.
        This range is a CIDR specification, for example: `192.168.0.0/16`.
        The resource must be recreated to modify this field.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
        means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
        except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- routing_config
        The network-level routing configuration for this network. Used by Cloud Router to determine what type of network-wide routing
        behavior to enforce.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          routing_mode:
            choices:
            - REGIONAL
            - GLOBAL
            description:
            - The network-wide routing mode to use. If set to `REGIONAL`, this network's cloud
              routers will only advertise routes with subnetworks of this network in the same
              region as the router. If set to `GLOBAL`, this network's cloud routers will
              advertise routes with all subnetworks of this network, across regions.
            required: true
        
        version_added: 2.8
        

- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

      * Official Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_file using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the `GCP_AUTH_KIND' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set scopes using the `GCP_SCOPES' env variable.
      * Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
      * The `service_account_email' and `service_account_file' options are mutually exclusive.
