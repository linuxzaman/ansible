> CONSUL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/clustering/consul.py)

        Registers services and checks for an agent with a consul cluster. A service is some process running on the agent node that should
        be advertised by consul's discovery mechanism. It may optionally supply a check definition, a periodic service test to notify the
        consul cluster of service's health. Checks may also be registered per node e.g. disk usage, or cpu usage and notify the health of
        the entire node to the cluster. Service level checks do not require a check name or id as these are derived by Consul from the
        Service name and id respectively by appending 'service:' Node level checks require a check_name and optionally a check_id.
        Currently, there is no complete way to retrieve the script, interval or ttl metadata for a registered check. Without this
        metadata it is  not possible to tell if the data supplied with ansible represents a change to a check. As a result this does not
        attempt to determine changes and will always report a changed occurred. An api method is planned to supply this metadata so at
        that stage change management will be added. See http://consul.io for more details.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- check_id
        an ID for the service check, defaults to the check name, ignored if part of a service definition.
        [Default: (null)]

- check_name
        a name for the service check, defaults to the check id. required if standalone, ignored if part of service definition.
        [Default: (null)]

- host
        host of the consul agent defaults to localhost
        [Default: localhost]

- http
        checks can be registered with an http endpoint. This means that consul will check that the http endpoint returns a successful
        http status. Interval must also be provided with this option.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.0

- interval
        the interval at which the service check will be run. This is a number with a s or m suffix to signify the units of seconds or
        minutes e.g 15s or 1m. If no suffix is supplied, m will be used by default e.g. 1 will be 1m. Required if the script param is
        specified.
        [Default: (null)]

- notes
        Notes to attach to check when registering it.
        [Default: (null)]

- port
        the port on which the consul agent is running
        [Default: 8500]

- scheme
        the protocol scheme on which the consul agent is running
        [Default: http]
        version_added: 2.1

- script
        the script/command that will be run periodically to check the health of the service. Scripts require an interval and vise versa
        [Default: (null)]

- service_address
        the address to advertise that the service will be listening on. This value will be passed as the `Address' parameter to Consul's
        /v1/agent/service/register API method, so refer to the Consul API documentation for further details.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- service_id
        the ID for the service, must be unique per node, defaults to the service name if the service name is supplied
        [Default: service_name if supplied]

- service_name
        Unique name for the service on a node, must be unique per node, required if registering a service. May be omitted if registering
        a node level check
        [Default: (null)]

- service_port
        the port on which the service is listening. Can optionally be supplied for registration of a service, i.e. if service_name or
        service_id is set
        [Default: (null)]

= state
        register or deregister the consul service, defaults to present
        (Choices: present, absent)

- tags
        a list of tags that will be attached to the service registration.
        [Default: (null)]

- timeout
        A custom HTTP check timeout. The consul default is 10 seconds. Similar to the interval this is a number with a s or m suffix to
        signify the units of seconds or minutes, e.g. 15s or 1m.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.0

- token
        the token key indentifying an ACL rule set. May be required to register services.
        [Default: (null)]

- ttl
        checks can be registered with a ttl instead of a script and interval this means that the service will check in with the agent
        before the ttl expires. If it doesn't the check will be considered failed. Required if registering a check and the script an
        interval are missing Similar to the interval this is a number with a s or m suffix to signify the units of seconds or minutes e.g
        15s or 1m. If no suffix is supplied, m will be used by default e.g. 1 will be 1m
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        whether to verify the tls certificate of the consul agent
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.1
