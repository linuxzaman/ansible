> IOS_SYSTEM    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/ios/ios_system.py)

        This module provides declarative management of node system attributes on Cisco IOS devices.  It provides an option to configure
        host system parameters or remove those parameters from the device active configuration.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- domain_name
        Configure the IP domain name on the remote device to the provided value. Value should be in the dotted name form and will be
        appended to the `hostname' to create a fully-qualified domain name.
        [Default: (null)]

- domain_search
        Provides the list of domain suffixes to append to the hostname for the purpose of doing name resolution. This argument accepts a
        list of names and will be reconciled with the current active configuration on the running node.
        [Default: (null)]

- hostname
        Configure the device hostname parameter. This option takes an ASCII string value.
        [Default: (null)]

- lookup_enabled
        Administrative control for enabling or disabling DNS lookups.  When this argument is set to True, lookups are performed and when
        it is set to False, lookups are not performed.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- lookup_source
        Provides one or more source interfaces to use for performing DNS lookups.  The interface provided in `lookup_source' must be a
        valid interface configured on the device.
        [Default: (null)]

- name_servers
        List of DNS name servers by IP address to use to perform name resolution lookups.  This argument accepts either a list of DNS
        servers See examples.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.

            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over

            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will

              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'

          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is

- state
        State of the configuration values in the device's current active configuration.  When set to `present', the values should be

        configuration
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
