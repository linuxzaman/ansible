> FORTIOS_SYSTEM_VIRTUAL_WAN_LINK    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_system_virtual_wan_link.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify system feature and
        virtual_wan_link category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested
        with FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
