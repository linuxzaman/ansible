OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- cloudwatch_logs_log_group_arn
        A full ARN specifying a valid CloudWatch log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. The log group should already
        exist.
        See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.html.
        Required when `cloudwatch_logs_role_arn'.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- cloudwatch_logs_role_arn
        Specifies a full ARN for an IAM role that assigns the proper permissions for CloudTrail to create and write to the log group.
        See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.html.
        Required when `cloudwatch_logs_log_group_arn'.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- enable_log_file_validation
        Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled.
        CloudTrail will create a hash for every log file delivered and produce a signed digest file that can be used to ensure log files
        have not been tampered.
        (Aliases: log_file_validation_enabled)[Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- enable_logging
        Start or stop the CloudTrail logging. If stopped the trail will be paused and will not record events or deliver log files.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- include_global_events
        Record API calls from global services such as IAM and STS.
        (Aliases: include_global_service_events)[Default: True]
        type: bool

- is_multi_region_trail
        Specify whether the trail belongs only to one region or exists in all regions.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- kms_key_id
        Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. This also has the effect of enabling log file
        encryption.
        The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a
        globally unique identifier.
        See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.html.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

= name
        Name for the CloudTrail.
        Names are unique per-region unless the CloudTrail is a multi-region trail, in which case it is unique per-account.


- profile
        Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- region
        The AWS region to use. If not specified then the value of the AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION environment variable, if any, is used. See

        (Aliases: aws_region, ec2_region)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- s3_bucket_name
        An existing S3 bucket where CloudTrail will deliver log files.
        This bucket should exist and have the proper policy.
        See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_bucket_policy.html.
        Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- s3_key_prefix
        S3 Key prefix for delivered log files. A trailing slash is not necessary and will be removed.
        [Default: (null)]

        The following states have been preserved for backwards compatibility. `state=enabled' and `state=disabled'.
        enabled=present and disabled=absent.
        (Choices: present, absent, enabled, disabled)

- tags
        A hash/dictionary of tags to be applied to the CloudTrail resource.
        Remove completely or specify an empty dictionary to remove all tags.
        [Default: {}]
        version_added: 2.4

        version_added: 1.5


NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  boto, boto3, botocore, python >= 2.6
