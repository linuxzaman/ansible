> WIN_AUDIT_RULE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_audit_rule.py)

        Used to apply audit rules to files, folders or registry keys. Once applied, it will begin recording the user who performed the
        operation defined into the Security Log in the Event viewer. The behavior is designed to ignore inherited rules since those
        cannot be adjusted without first disabling the inheritance behavior. It will still print inherited rules in the output though for
        debugging purposes.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= audit_flags
        Defines whether to log on failure, success, or both.
        To log both define as comma separated list "Success, Failure".
        (Choices: Failure, Success)
        type: list

- inheritance_flags
        Defines what objects inside of a folder or registry key will inherit the settings.
        If you are setting a rule on a file, this value has to be changed to `none'.
        For more information on the choices see MSDN PropagationFlags enumeration at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
        us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.inheritanceflags.aspx.
        (Choices: ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit)[Default: ContainerInherit,ObjectInherit]
        type: list

= path
        Path to the file, folder, or registry key.
        Registry paths should be in Powershell format, beginning with an abbreviation for the root such as, `HKLM:\Software'.
        (Aliases: dest, destination)
        type: path

- propagation_flags
        Propagation flag on the audit rules.
        This value is ignored when the path type is a file.
        For more information on the choices see MSDN PropagationFlags enumeration at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
        us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.propagationflags.aspx.
        (Choices: None, InherityOnly, NoPropagateInherit)[Default: None]

= rights
        Comma separated list of the rights desired. Only required for adding a rule.
        If `path' is a file or directory, rights can be any right under MSDN FileSystemRights https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
        us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.filesystemrights.aspx.
        If `path' is a registry key, rights can be any right under MSDN RegistryRights https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
        us/library/system.security.accesscontrol.registryrights.aspx.

        type: list

- state
        Whether the rule should be `present' or `absent'.
        For absent, only `path', `user', and `state' are required.
        Specifying `absent' will remove all rules matching the defined `user'.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

= user
        The user or group to adjust rules for.

        type: str
