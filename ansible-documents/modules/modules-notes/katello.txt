        The action "None" means no action specified.
        Possible Params in relation to entity and action.
        name ([product,sync,None], [repository,sync], [repository_set,None], [sync_plan,None],
        [content_view,promote,publish,None], [lifecycle_environment,None], [activation_key,None])
        organization ([product,sync,None] ,[repository,sync,None], [repository_set,None], [sync_plan,None],
        [content_view,promote,publish,None], [lifecycle_environment,None], [activation_key,None])
        content ([manifest,None])
        product ([repository,sync,None], [repository_set,None], [sync_plan,None])
        basearch ([repository_set,None])

# Best Practices

# In Foreman, things can be done in paralell.
# When a conflicting action is already running,
# the task will fail instantly instead of waiting for the already running action to complete.
# So you sould use a "until success" loop to catch this.
