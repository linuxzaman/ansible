> HTPASSWD    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/web_infrastructure/htpasswd.py)

        Add and remove username/password entries in a password file using htpasswd. This is used by web servers such as Apache and Nginx
        for basic authentication.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- attributes
        The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.
        To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr' on the target system.
        This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr'.
        The `=' operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+' or `-' operators need to be included in the string.
        (Aliases: attr)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

- create
        Used with `state=present'. If specified, the file will be created if it does not already exist. If set to "no", will fail if the
        file does not exist
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- crypt_scheme
        Encryption scheme to be used.  As well as the four choices listed here, you can also use any other hash supported by passlib,
        such as md5_crypt and sha256_crypt, which are linux passwd hashes.  If you do so the password file will not be compatible with
        Apache or Nginx
        (Choices: apr_md5_crypt, des_crypt, ldap_sha1, plaintext)[Default: apr_md5_crypt]

- group
        Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- mode
        The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.
        For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod' remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that
        Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644' or `01777') or quote it (like `'644'' or `'1777'') so Ansible
        receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
        Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
        results.
        As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx' or `u=rw,g=r,o=r').
        As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string `preserve'.
        When set to `preserve' the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        User name to add or remove
        (Aliases: username)

- owner
        Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- password
        Password associated with user.
        Must be specified if user does not exist yet.
        [Default: (null)]

= path
        Path to the file that contains the usernames and passwords
        (Aliases: dest, destfile)

- selevel
        The level part of the SELinux file context.
        This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range'.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `level' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: s0]
        type: str

- serole
        The role part of the SELinux file context.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `role' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- setype
        The type part of the SELinux file context.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `type' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- seuser
        The user part of the SELinux file context.
        By default it uses the `system' policy, where applicable.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `user' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        Whether the user entry should be present or not
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- unsafe_writes
        Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.
        By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but
        sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be
        updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
        This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't
        force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
        IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2


NOTES:
      * This module depends on the `passlib' Python library, which needs to be installed on all target systems.
      * On Debian, Ubuntu, or Fedora: install `python-passlib'.
      * On RHEL or CentOS: Enable EPEL, then install `python-passlib'.
