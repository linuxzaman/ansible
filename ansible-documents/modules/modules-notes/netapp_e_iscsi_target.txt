        Configure the settings of an E-Series iSCSI target

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- chap_secret
        Enable Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), utilizing this value as the password.
        When this value is specified, we will always trigger an update (changed=True). We have no way of verifying whether or not the
        password has changed.
        The chap secret may only use ascii characters with values between 32 and 126 decimal.
        The chap secret must be no less than 12 characters, but no greater than 57 characters in length.
        The chap secret is cleared when not specified or an empty string.
        (Aliases: chap, password)[Default: (null)]

- log_path
        A local path (on the Ansible controller), to a file to be used for debug logging.
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        The name/alias to assign to the iSCSI target.
        This alias is often used by the initiator software in order to make an iSCSI target easier to identify.
        (Aliases: alias)[Default: (null)]

- ping
        Enable ICMP ping responses from the configured iSCSI ports.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- unnamed_discovery
        When an initiator initiates a discovery session to an initiator port, it is considered an unnamed discovery session if the iSCSI
        target iqn is not specified in the request.
        This option may be disabled to increase security if desired.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * Some of the settings are dependent on the settings applied to the iSCSI interfaces. These can be configured using
        [netapp_e_iscsi_interface].
      * This module requires a Web Services API version of >= 1.3.
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
