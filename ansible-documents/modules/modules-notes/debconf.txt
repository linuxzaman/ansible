> DEBCONF    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/debconf.py)

        Configure a .deb package using debconf-set-selections. Or just query existing selections.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= name
        Name of package to configure.
        (Aliases: pkg)
        type: str

        A debconf configuration setting.
        (Aliases: selection, setting)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

        Do not set 'seen' flag when pre-seeding.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

        Value to set the configuration to.
        (Aliases: answer)[Default: (null)]

        `seen' was added in Ansible 2.2.

NOTES:
      * This module requires the command line debconf tools.
      * A number of questions have to be answered (depending on the package). Use 'debconf-show <package>' on any Debian or
        derivative with the package installed to see questions/settings available.
      * Some distros will always record tasks involving the setting of passwords as changed. This is due to debconf-get-selections
        masking passwords.
