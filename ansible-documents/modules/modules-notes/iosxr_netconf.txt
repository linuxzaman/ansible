> IOSXR_NETCONF    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/iosxr/iosxr_netconf.py)

        This module provides an abstraction that enables and configures the netconf system service running on Cisco IOS-XR Software. This
        module can be used to easily enable the Netconf API. Netconf provides a programmatic interface for working with configuration and
        state resources as defined in RFC 6242.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- netconf_port
        This argument specifies the port the netconf service should listen on for SSH connections.  The default port as defined in RFC
        6242 is 830.
        (Aliases: listens_on)[Default: 830]

- netconf_vrf
        netconf vrf name
        (Aliases: vrf)[Default: default]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(Network Guide, ../network/getting_started/network_differences.html#multiple-communication-
        protocols).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over

          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'

            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict

- state
        Specifies the state of the `iosxr_netconf' resource on the remote device.  If the `state' argument is set to `present' the
        netconf service will be configured.  If the `state' argument is set to `absent' the netconf service will be removed from the
        configuration.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
