> NET_PUT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/files/net_put.py)

        This module provides functionality to copy file from Ansible controller to network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- dest
        Specifies the destination file. The path to destination file can either be the full path or relative path as supported by
        network_os.
        [Default: [u'Filename from src and at default directory of user shell on network_os.']]

- mode
        Set the file transfer mode. If mode is set to `text' then `src' file will go through Jinja2 template engine to replace any vars
        if present in the src file. If mode is set to `binary' then file will be copied as it is to destination device.
        (Choices: binary, text)[Default: binary]
        version_added: 2.7

- protocol
        Protocol used to transfer file.
        (Choices: scp, sftp)[Default: scp]

= src
        Specifies the source file. The path to the source file can either be the full path on the Ansible control host or a relative path
        from the playbook or role root directory.



NOTES:
      * Some devices need specific configurations to be enabled before scp can work These configuration should be pre-configured
        before using this module e.g ios - `ip scp server enable'.
      * User privilege to do scp on network device should be pre-configured e.g. ios - need user privilege 15 by default for
        allowing scp.
      * Default destination of source file.
      * This module is supported on `ansible_network_os' network platforms. See the :ref:`Network Platform Options
        <platform_options>` for details.
