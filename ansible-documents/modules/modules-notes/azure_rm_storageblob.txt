> AZURE_RM_STORAGEBLOB    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/azure/azure_rm_storageblob.py)

        Create, update and delete blob containers and blob objects. Use to upload a file and store it as a blob object, or download a
        blob object to a file.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- ad_user
        Active Directory username. Use when authenticating with an Active Directory user rather than service principal.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- adfs_authority_url
        Azure AD authority url. Use when authenticating with Username/password, and has your own ADFS authority.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6

- api_profile
        Selects an API profile to use when communicating with Azure services. Default value of `latest' is appropriate for public clouds;
        future values will allow use with Azure Stack.
        [Default: latest]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

- append_tags
        Use to control if tags field is canonical or just appends to existing tags.
        When canonical, any tags not found in the tags parameter will be removed from the object's metadata.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- auth_source
        Controls the source of the credentials to use for authentication.
        If not specified, ANSIBLE_AZURE_AUTH_SOURCE environment variable will be used and default to `auto' if variable is not defined.
        `auto' will follow the default precedence of module parameters -> environment variables -> default profile in credential file
        `~/.azure/credentials'.
        When set to `cli', the credentials will be sources from the default Azure CLI profile.
        Can also be set via the `ANSIBLE_AZURE_AUTH_SOURCE' environment variable.
        When set to `msi', the host machine must be an azure resource with an enabled MSI extension. `subscription_id' or the environment
        variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID' can be used to identify the subscription ID if the resource is granted access to more than one
        subscription, otherwise the first subscription is chosen.
        The `msi' was added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Choices: auto, cli, credential_file, env, msi)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

- blob
        Name of a blob object within the container.
        (Aliases: blob_name)[Default: (null)]

- blob_type
        Type of Blob Object.
        (Choices: block, page)[Default: block]
        version_added: 2.5

- cache_control
        Set the blob cache-control header.
        [Default: (null)]

- cert_validation_mode
        Controls the certificate validation behavior for Azure endpoints. By default, all modules will validate the server certificate,
        but when an HTTPS proxy is in use, or against Azure Stack, it may be necessary to disable this behavior by passing `ignore'. Can
        also be set via credential file profile or the `AZURE_CERT_VALIDATION' environment variable.
        (Choices: ignore, validate)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

- client_id
        Azure client ID. Use when authenticating with a Service Principal.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- cloud_environment
        For cloud environments other than the US public cloud, the environment name (as defined by Azure Python SDK, eg,
        `AzureChinaCloud', `AzureUSGovernment'), or a metadata discovery endpoint URL (required for Azure Stack). Can also be set via
        credential file profile or the `AZURE_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT' environment variable.
        [Default: AzureCloud]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.4

= container
        Name of a blob container within the storage account.
        (Aliases: container_name)

        Set the blob content-disposition header.
        [Default: (null)]

        [Default: (null)]

- content_md5
        Set the blob md5 hash value.
        [Default: (null)]

- content_type
        Set the blob content-type header. For example, 'image/png'.
        [Default: (null)]

- dest
        Destination file path. Use with state `present' to download a blob.
        (Aliases: destination)[Default: (null)]

- force
        Overwrite existing blob or file when uploading or downloading. Force deletion of a container that contains blobs.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- password
        Active Directory user password. Use when authenticating with an Active Directory user rather than service principal.

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- public_access
        Determine a container's level of public access. By default containers are private. Can only be set at time of container creation.

= resource_group
        Name of the resource group to use.
        (Aliases: resource_group_name)

- secret
        Azure client secret. Use when authenticating with a Service Principal.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- src
        Source file path. Use with state `present' to upload a blob.
        (Aliases: source)[Default: (null)]

- state
        Assert the state of a container or blob.
        Use state `absent' with a container value only to delete a container. Include a blob value to remove a specific blob. A container
        will not be deleted, if it contains blobs. Use the force option to override, deleting the container and all associated blobs.
        Use state `present' to create or update a container and upload or download a blob. If the container does not exist, it will be
        created. If it exists, it will be updated with configuration options. Provide a blob name and either src or dest to upload or
        download. Provide a src path to upload and a dest path to download. If a blob (uploading) or a file (downloading) already exists,
        it will not be overwritten unless the force parameter is true.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]

= storage_account_name

- tenant
        Azure tenant ID. Use when authenticating with a Service Principal.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * For authentication with Azure you can pass parameters, set environment variables, use a profile stored in
        ~/.azure/credentials, or log in before you run your tasks or playbook with `az login'.
      * Authentication is also possible using a service principal or Active Directory user.
      * To authenticate via service principal, pass subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or set environment variables
        AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_SECRET and AZURE_TENANT.
      * To authenticate via Active Directory user, pass ad_user and password, or set AZURE_AD_USER and AZURE_PASSWORD in the
        environment.
      * Alternatively, credentials can be stored in ~/.azure/credentials. This is an ini file containing a [default] section and
        the following keys: subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or subscription_id, ad_user and password. It is also
        possible to add additional profiles. Specify the profile by passing profile or setting AZURE_PROFILE in the environment.
