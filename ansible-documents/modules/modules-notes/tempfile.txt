> TEMPFILE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/files/tempfile.py)

        The `tempfile' module creates temporary files and directories. `mktemp' command takes different parameters on various systems,
        this module helps to avoid troubles related to that. Files/directories created by module are accessible only by creator. In case
        you need to make them world-accessible you need to use [file] module. For Windows targets, use the [win_tempfile] module instead.
