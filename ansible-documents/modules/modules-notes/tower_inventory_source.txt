- overwrite
        If set, any hosts and groups that were previously present on the external source but are now removed will be removed from the
        Tower inventory. Hosts and groups that were not managed by the inventory source will be promoted to the next manually created
        group or if there is no manually created group to promote them into, they will be left in the "all" default group for the
        inventory. When not checked, local child hosts and groups not found on the external source will remain untouched by the inventory
        update process.
        [Default: (null)]

        performed.
        [Default: (null)]

- update_on_launch
        Each time a job runs using this inventory, refresh the inventory from the selected source before executing job tasks.

NOTES:
      * If no `config_file' is provided we will attempt to use the tower-cli library defaults to find your Tower host information.
      * `config_file' should contain Tower configuration in the following format host=hostname username=username password=password
