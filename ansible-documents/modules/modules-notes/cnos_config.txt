        Lenovo CNOS configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections.  This module
        provides an implementation for working with CNOS configuration sections in a deterministic way.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- admin
        Enters into administration configuration mode for making config changes to the device.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- after
        The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made.  Just like with `before' this
        allows the playbook designer to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.
        [Default: (null)]

- backup
        This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current `running-config' from the remote device before any
        changes are made. If the `backup_options' value is not given, the backup file is written to the `backup' folder in the playbook
        root directory. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- backup_options
        This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when
        `backup' is set to `yes', if `backup' is set to `no' this option will be silently ignored.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          dir_path:
            description:
            - This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup
              configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
              first created and the filename is either the value of `filename' or default
              filename as described in `filename' options description. If the path value
              is not given in that case a `backup' directory will be created in the current
              working directory and backup configuration will be copied in `filename' within
              `backup' directory.
            type: path
          filename:
            description:
            - The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename
              is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
              in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.8

- before
        The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made.  This allows the playbook designer the
        opportunity to perform configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched
        against the system.
        [Default: (null)]

- comment
        Allows a commit description to be specified to be included when the configuration is committed.  If the configuration is not
        changed or committed, this argument is ignored.
        [Default: configured by cnos_config]

- config
        The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing
        against the contents of source.  There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for
        every task in a playbook.  The `config' argument allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config
        for comparison.
        [Default: (null)]

- lines
        The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section.  The commands must be the exact same commands as found in
        the device running-config.  Be sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the
        device config parser.
        (Aliases: commands)[Default: (null)]

- match
        Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config.  If match is
        set to `line', commands are matched line by line.  If match is set to `strict', command lines are matched with respect to
        position.  If match is set to `exact', command lines must be an equal match.  Finally, if match is set to `none', the module will
        not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
        (Choices: line, strict, exact, none)[Default: line]

- parents
        The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section the commands should be checked against.  If the parents argument is
        omitted, the commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.
        [Default: (null)]

- replace
        Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device.  If the replace argument is set to `line' then the
        modified lines are pushed to the device in configuration mode.  If the replace argument is set to `block' then the entire command
        block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is not correct.
        (Choices: line, block, config)[Default: line]

- src
        Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load.  The path to the source
        file can either be the full path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory.  This
        argument is mutually exclusive with `lines', `parents'.
        [Default: (null)]
