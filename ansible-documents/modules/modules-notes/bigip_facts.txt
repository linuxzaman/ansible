        Collect facts from F5 BIG-IP devices via iControl SOAP API

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: The bigip_facts module relies on SOAP to communicate with the BIG-IP, and has a large amount of code that does not conform to existing F5 standards. The M(bigip_device_facts) module is easier to maintain and use.

	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.11
	Alternatives: bigip_device_facts

NOTES:
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 11.4
      * F5 developed module 'bigsuds' required (see http://devcentral.f5.com)
      * Best run as a local_action in your playbook
      * Tested with manager and above account privilege level
      * `provision' facts were added in 2.2
      * This module is deprecated. Use the `bigip_device_facts' module instead.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
