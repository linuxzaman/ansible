NOTES:
      * This module does not behave like other modules that you might include in roles where referencing files or templates first
        looks in the role's files or templates directory. To have it behave that way, use the Ansible file or template lookup (see
        Examples). The lookups behave as expected in a role context.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.


REQUIREMENTS:  BIG-IP >= v12
