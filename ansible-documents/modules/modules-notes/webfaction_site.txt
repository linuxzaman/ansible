        Add or remove a website on a Webfaction host.  Further documentation at https://github.com/quentinsf/ansible-webfaction.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= host
        The webfaction host on which the site should be created.


- https
        Whether or not to use HTTPS
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

= login_name
        The webfaction account to use


= login_password
        The webfaction password to use


= name
        The name of the website


- site_apps
        A mapping of URLs to apps
        [Default: []]

- state
        Whether the website should exist
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subdomains
        A list of subdomains associated with this site.
        [Default: []]


NOTES:
      * Sadly, you `do' need to know your webfaction hostname for the `host' parameter.  But at least, unlike the API, you don't
        need to know the IP address. You can use a DNS name.
      * If a site of the same name exists in the account but on a different host, the operation will exit.
      * You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the
        remote webfaction API. The location is not important. However, running them on multiple hosts `simultaneously' is best
        avoided. If you don't specify `localhost' as your host, you may want to add `serial: 1' to the plays.
      * See `the webfaction API <https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/>`_ for more info.
