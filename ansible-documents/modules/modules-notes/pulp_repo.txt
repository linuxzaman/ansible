OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- add_export_distributor
        Whether or not to add the export distributor to new `rpm' repositories.
        [Default: no]

- ca_cert
        CA certificate string used to validate the feed source SSL certificate. This can be the file content or the path to the file.
        (Aliases: importer_ssl_ca_cert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_cert
        Certificate used as the client certificate when synchronizing the repository. This is used to communicate authentication
        information to the feed source. The value to this option must be the full path to the certificate. The specified file may be the
        certificate itself or a single file containing both the certificate and private key. This can be the file content or the path to
        the file.
        (Aliases: importer_ssl_client_cert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_key
        Private key to the certificate specified in `importer_ssl_client_cert', assuming it is not included in the certificate file
        itself. This can be the file content or the path to the file.
        (Aliases: importer_ssl_client_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- feed
        Upstream feed URL to receive updates from.

- force_basic_auth
        httplib2, the library used by the [uri] module only sends authentication information when a webservice responds to an initial
        request with a 401 status. Since some basic auth services do not properly send a 401, logins will fail. This option forces the
        sending of the Basic authentication header upon initial request.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- generate_sqlite
        Boolean flag to indicate whether sqlite files should be generated during a repository publish.

        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

        Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.
        [Default: ansible-httpget]
        type: str

        Name of the repo to add or remove. This correlates to repo-id in Pulp.

        URL of the pulp server to connect to.
        [Default: http://127.0.0.1]

= relative_url
        Relative URL for the local repository.


- repo_type
        Repo plugin type to use (i.e. `rpm', `docker').
        [Default: rpm]

- repoview
        Whether to generate repoview files for a published repository. Setting this to "yes" automatically activates `generate_sqlite`.

        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- state
        The repo state. A state of `sync' will queue a sync of the repo. This is asynchronous but not delayed like a scheduled sync. A
        state of `publish' will use the repository's distributor to publish the content.
        (Choices: present, absent, sync, publish)[Default: present]

- url
        HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
        certificates.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

        Wait for asynchronous tasks to complete before returning.

        types are welcome.
