> WAIT_FOR_CONNECTION    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/utilities/logic/wait_for_connection.py)

        Waits for a total of `timeout' seconds. Retries the transport connection after a timeout of `connect_timeout'. Tests the
        transport connection every `sleep' seconds. This module makes use of internal ansible transport (and configuration) and the
        ping/win_ping module to guarantee correct end-to-end functioning. This module is also supported for Windows targets.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.
