> EOS_VLAN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/eos/eos_vlan.py)

        This module provides declarative management of VLANs on Arista EOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of VLANs definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- associated_interfaces
        This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vlan `name' for associated interfaces. The name of
        interface is case sensitive and should be in expanded format and not abbreviated. If the value in the `associated_interfaces'
        does not match with the operational state of vlan interfaces on device it will result in failure.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.5

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- delay
        Delay the play should wait to check for declarative intent params values.
        [Default: 10]

- interfaces
        List of interfaces that should be associated to the VLAN. The name of interface is case sensitive and should be in expanded
        format and not abbreviated.
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        Name of the VLAN.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE

              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.

          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              is a common argument used for either `cli' or `eapi' transports. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.

            default: 0 (use common port)
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `eapi'.  The port value will default to the
