> EC2_LAUNCH_TEMPLATE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/amazon/ec2_launch_template.py)

        Create, modify, and delete EC2 Launch Templates, which can be used to create individual instances or with Autoscaling Groups. The
        `ec2_instance' and `ec2_asg' modules can, instead of specifying all parameters on those tasks, be passed a Launch Template which
        contains settings like instance size, disk type, subnet, and more.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is

- block_device_mappings
        The block device mapping. Supplying both a snapshot ID and an encryption value as arguments for block-device mapping results in
        an error. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on start, and these are not created from a snapshot. If a snapshot
        is the basis for the volume, it contains data by definition and its encryption status cannot be changed using this action.

NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file
