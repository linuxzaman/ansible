OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggr_list

        These aggregates could be shared for use with other Vservers.
        When specified as part of a vserver-create, this field represents the list of aggregates that are assigned to the Vserver for
        volume operations.
        When part of vserver-get-iter call, this will return the list of Vservers which have any of the aggregates specified as part of
        the aggr list.

        Allowed Protocols.
        When specified as part of a vserver-create, this field represent the list of protocols allowed on the Vserver.
        When part of vserver-get-iter call, this will return the list of Vservers which have any of the protocols specified as part of
        the allowed-protocols.
        When part of vserver-modify, this field should include the existing list along with new protocol list to be added to prevent data
        disruptions.

NOTES:
      * The modules prefixed with na\\_ontap are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.


REQUIREMENTS:  A physical or virtual clustered Data ONTAP system. The modules support Data ONTAP 9.1 and onward, Ansible 2.6, Python2
        netapp-lib (2017.10.30) or later. Install using 'pip install netapp-lib', Python3 netapp-lib (2018.11.13) or
        later. Install using 'pip install netapp-lib', To enable http on the cluster you must run the following commands
        'set -privilege advanced;' 'system services web modify -http-enabled true;'
