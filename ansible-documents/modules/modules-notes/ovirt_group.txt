EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Add group group1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
- ovirt_group:
    name: group1
    domain: example.com-authz

# Add group group1 from authorization provider example.com-authz
# In case of multi-domain Active Directory setup, you should pass
# also namespace, so it adds correct group:
- ovirt_group:
    name: group1
    namespace: dc=ad2,dc=example,dc=com
    domain: example.com-authz

# Remove group group1 with authorization provider example.com-authz
- ovirt_group:
    state: absent
    name: group1
    domain: example.com-authz
