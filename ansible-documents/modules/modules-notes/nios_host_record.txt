> NIOS_HOST_RECORD    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/net_tools/nios/nios_host_record.py)

        Adds and/or removes instances of host record objects from Infoblox NIOS servers.  This module manages NIOS `record:host' objects
        using the Infoblox WAPI interface over REST. Updates instances of host record object from Infoblox NIOS servers.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
