> HG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/source_control/hg.py)

        Manages Mercurial (hg) repositories. Supports SSH, HTTP/S and local address.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- clone
        If `no', do not clone the repository if it does not exist locally.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.3

= dest
        Absolute path of where the repository should be cloned to. This parameter is required, unless clone and update are set to no


- executable
        Path to hg executable to use. If not supplied, the normal mechanism for resolving binary paths will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.4

- force
        Discards uncommitted changes. Runs `hg update -C'.  Prior to 1.9, the default was `yes`.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- purge
        Deletes untracked files. Runs `hg purge'.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

= repo
        The repository address.
        (Aliases: name)

- revision
        Equivalent `-r' option in hg command which could be the changeset, revision number, branch name or even tag.
        (Aliases: version)[Default: (null)]

- update
        If `no', do not retrieve new revisions from the origin repository
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * This module does not support push capability. See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/31156.
      * If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in `known_hosts'. SSH will prompt user to authorize the first
        contact with a remote host.  To avoid this prompt, one solution is to add the remote host public key in
        `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts' before calling the hg module, with the following command: ssh-keyscan remote_host.com >>
        /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.
      * As per 01 Dec 2018, Bitbucket has dropped support for TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connections. As such, if the underlying system
        still uses a Python version below 2.7.9, you will have issues checking out bitbucket repositories. See
        https://bitbucket.org/blog/deprecating-tlsv1-tlsv1-1-2018-12-01.
