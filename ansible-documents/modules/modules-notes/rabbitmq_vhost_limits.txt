        Max number of queues.

# Limit both of the max number of connections and queues on the vhost '/'.
- rabbitmq_vhost_limits:
    vhost: /
    max_connections: 64
    max_queues: 256
    state: present

# Limit the max number of connections on the vhost '/'.
# This task implicitly clears the max number of queues limit using default value: -1.
- rabbitmq_vhost_limits:
    vhost: /
    max_connections: 64
    state: present

# Clear the limits on the vhost '/'.
- rabbitmq_vhost_limits:
    vhost: /
    state: absent
