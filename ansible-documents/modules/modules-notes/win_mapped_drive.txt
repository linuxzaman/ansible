> WIN_MAPPED_DRIVE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_mapped_drive.py)

        Allows you to modify mapped network drives for individual users.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= letter
        The letter of the network path to map to.
        This letter must not already be in use with Windows.

        type: str

- password
        The password for `username' that is used when testing the initial connection.
        This is never saved with a mapped drive, use the [win_credential] module to persist a username and password for a host.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- path
        The UNC path to map the drive to.
        This is required if `state=present'.
        If `state=absent' and `path' is not set, the module will delete the mapped drive regardless of the target.
        If `state=absent' and the `path' is set, the module will throw an error if path does not match the target of the mapped drive.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        If `present' will ensure the mapped drive exists.
        If `absent' will ensure the mapped drive does not exist.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- username
        The username that is used when testing the initial connection.
        This is never saved with a mapped drive, the the [win_credential] module to persist a username and password for a host.
        This is required if the mapped drive requires authentication with custom credentials and become, or CredSSP cannot be used.
        If become or CredSSP is used, any credentials saved with [win_credential] will automatically be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * You cannot use this module to access a mapped drive in another Ansible task, drives mapped with this module are only
        accessible when logging in interactively with the user through the console or RDP.
      * It is recommend to run this module with become or CredSSP when the remote path requires authentication.
      * When using become or CredSSP, the task will have access to any local credentials stored in the user's vault.
      * If become or CredSSP is not available, the `username' and `password' options can be used for the initial authentication but
        these are not persisted.
