> MEMSET_ZONE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/memset/memset_zone.py)

        Manage DNS zones in a Memset account.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_key
        The API key obtained from the Memset control panel.


- force
        Forces deletion of a zone and all zone domains/zone records it contains.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= name
        The zone nickname; usually the same as the main domain. Ensure this value has at most 250 characters.
        (Aliases: nickname)

= state
        Indicates desired state of resource.
        (Choices: absent, present)

- ttl
        The default TTL for all records created in the zone. This must be a valid int from
        https://www.memset.com/apidocs/methods_dns.html#dns.zone_create.
        (Choices: 0, 300, 600, 900, 1800, 3600, 7200, 10800, 21600, 43200, 86400)[Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Zones can be thought of as a logical group of domains, all of which share the same DNS records (i.e. they point to the same
        IP). An API key generated via the Memset customer control panel is needed with the following minimum scope -
        `dns.zone_create', `dns.zone_delete', `dns.zone_list'.
