> WIN_PARTITION    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_partition.py)

        The [win_partition] module can create, modify or delete a partition on a disk

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- active
        Specifies if the partition is active and can be used to start the system. This property is only valid when the disk's partition
        style is MBR.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- disk_number
        Disk number is mandatory for creating new partitions.
        A combination of `disk_number' and `partition_number' can be used to specify the partition instead of `drive_letter' if required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- drive_letter
        Used for accessing partitions if `disk_number' and `partition_number' are not provided.
        Use `auto' for automatically assigning a drive letter, or a letter A-Z for manually assigning a drive letter to a new partition.
        If not specified, no drive letter is assigned when creating a new partition.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- gpt_type
        Specify the partition's GPT type if the disk's partition style is GPT.
        This only applies to new partitions.
        This does not relate to the partitions file system formatting.
        (Choices: system_partition, microsoft_reserved, basic_data, microsoft_recovery)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- hidden
        Hides the target partition, making it undetectable by the mount manager.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- mbr_type
        Specify the partition's MBR type if the disk's partition style is MBR.
        This only applies to new partitions.
        This does not relate to the partitions file system formatting.
        (Choices: fat12, fat16, extended, huge, ifs, fat32)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- offline
        Sets the partition offline.
        Adding a mount point (such as a drive letter) will cause the partition to go online again.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- partition_number
        Used in conjunction with `disk_number' to uniquely identify a partition.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- partition_size
        Specify size of the partition in B, KB, KiB, MB, MiB, GB, GiB, TB or TiB. Use -1 to specify maximum supported size.
        Partition size is mandatory for creating a new partition but not for updating or deleting a partition.
        The decimal SI prefixes kilo, mega, giga, tera, etc., are powers of 10^3 = 1000. The binary prefixes kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, etc.
        respectively refer to the corresponding power of 2^10 = 1024. Thus, a gigabyte (GB) is 1000000000 (1000^3) bytes while 1 gibibyte
        (GiB) is 1073741824 (1024^3) bytes.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- read_only
        Make the partition read only, restricting changes from being made to the partition.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- state
        Used to specify the state of the partition. Use `absent' to specify if a partition should be removed and `present' to specify if
        the partition should be created or updated.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * A minimum Operating System Version of 6.2 is required to use this module. To check if your OS is compatible, see
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/sysinfo/operating-system-version.
      * This module cannot be used for removing the drive letter associated with a partition, initializing a disk or, file system
        formatting.
      * Idempotence works only if you're specifying a drive letter or other unique attributes such as a combination of disk number
        and partition number.
