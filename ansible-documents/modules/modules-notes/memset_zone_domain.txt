> MEMSET_ZONE_DOMAIN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/memset/memset_zone_domain.py)

        Manage DNS zone domains in a Memset account.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_key
        The API key obtained from the Memset control panel.


= domain
        The zone domain name. Ensure this value has at most 250 characters.
        (Aliases: name)

- state
        Indicates desired state of resource.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]

= zone
        The zone to add the domain to (this must already exist).



NOTES:
      * Zone domains can be thought of as a collection of domains, all of which share the same DNS records (i.e. they point to the
        same IP). An API key generated via the Memset customer control panel is needed with the following minimum scope -
        `dns.zone_domain_create', `dns.zone_domain_delete', `dns.zone_domain_list'.
      * Currently this module can only create one domain at a time. Multiple domains should be created using `with_items'.
