> GCP_COMPUTE_TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gcp_compute_target_vpn_gateway.py)

        Represents a VPN gateway running in GCP. This virtual device is managed by Google, but used only by you.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- description
        An optional description of this resource.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which

        except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


= network
        The network this VPN gateway is accepting traffic for.
        This field represents a link to a Network resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_network task and then set this network field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"


- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= region
        The region this gateway should sit in.


- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * API Reference: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/targetVpnGateways
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_file using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the `GCP_AUTH_KIND' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set scopes using the `GCP_SCOPES' env variable.
      * Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
      * The `service_account_email' and `service_account_file' options are mutually exclusive.
