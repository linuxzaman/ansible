        Manages DNS monitors on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- accept_rcode
        Specifies the RCODE required in the response for an up status.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default value is `no-error'.
        When `no-error', specifies that the status of the node will be marked up if the received DNS message has no error.
        When `anything', specifies that the status of the node will be marked up irrespective of the RCODE in the DNS message received.
        If this parameter is set to `anything', it will disregard the `receive' string, and nullify it if the monitor is being updated.
        (Choices: no-error, anything)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- adaptive
        Specifies whether adaptive response time monitoring is enabled for this monitor.
        When `yes', the monitor determines the state of a service based on how divergent from the mean latency a monitor probe for that
        service is allowed to be. Also, values for the `allowed_divergence', `adaptive_limit', and and `sampling_timespan' will be
        enforced.
        When `disabled', the monitor determines the state of a service based on the `interval', `up_interval', `time_until_up', and
        `timeout' monitor settings.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- adaptive_limit
        Specifies the absolute number of milliseconds that may not be exceeded by a monitor probe, regardless of `allowed_divergence'
        setting, for a probe to be considered successful.
        This value applies regardless of the value of the `allowed_divergence' setting.
        While this value can be configured when `adaptive' is `no', it will not take effect on the system until `adaptive' is `yes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- allowed_divergence_type
        When specifying a new monitor, if `adaptive' is `yes', the default is `relative'
        When `absolute', the number of milliseconds the latency of a monitor probe can exceed the mean latency of a monitor probe for the
        service being probed. In typical cases, if the monitor detects three probes in a row that miss the latency value you set, the
        pool member or node is marked down.
        When `relative', the percentage of deviation the latency of a monitor probe can exceed the mean latency of a monitor probe for
        the service being probed.
        (Choices: relative, absolute)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- allowed_divergence_value
        When specifying a new monitor, if `adaptive' is `yes', and `type' is `relative', the default is `25' percent.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- answer_section_contains
        Specifies the type of DNS query that the monitor sends.
        When creating a new monitor, if this value is not specified, the default value is `query-type'.
        When `query-type', specifies that the response should contain at least one answer of which the resource record type matches the
        query type.
        When `any-type', specifies that the DNS message should contain at least one answer.
        When `anything', specifies that an empty answer is enough to mark the status of the node up.
        (Choices: any-type, anything, query-type)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- description
        The description of the monitor.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- interval
        The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this template will run.
        This value *must* be less than the `timeout' value.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, the default `5' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition.
        If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be `*'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- manual_resume
        Specifies whether the system automatically changes the status of a resource to *enabled* at the next successful monitor check.
        If you set this option to `yes', you must manually re-enable the resource before the system can use it for load balancing
        connections.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default value is `no'.
        When `yes', specifies that you must manually re-enable the resource after an unsuccessful monitor check.
        When `no', specifies that the system automatically changes the status of a resource to *enabled* at the next successful monitor
        check.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        Specifies the name of the monitor.

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- query_type
        Specifies the type of DNS query that the monitor sends.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default value is `a'.

        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- reverse
        Specifies whether the monitor operates in reverse mode.
        When the monitor is in reverse mode, a successful receive string match marks the monitored object down instead of up. You can use
        the this mode only if you configure the `receive' option.
        This parameter is not compatible with the `time_until_up' parameter. If `time_until_up' is specified, it must be `0'. Or, if it
        already exists, it must be `0'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

        type: str

- time_until_up
        Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful response before a node will be marked up.
        A value of 0 will cause a node to be marked up immediately after a valid response is received from the node.
        If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be `0'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- timeout
        The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to the monitor request.
        If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up.
        If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down.
        You can change this number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the interval number of seconds plus 1 second.
        If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be `16'.

        type: bool

- up_interval
        Specifies the interval for the system to use to perform the health check when a resource is up.
        When `0', specifies that the system uses the interval specified in `interval' to check the health of the resource.
        When any other number, enables specification of a different interval to use when checking the health of a resource that is up.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, the default `0' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
