> EDGEOS_COMMAND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/edgeos/edgeos_command.py)

        This command module allows running one or more commands on a remote device running EdgeOS, such as the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter. This
        module does not support running commands in configuration mode. Certain `show' commands in EdgeOS produce many lines of output
        and use a custom pager that can cause this module to hang.  If the value of the environment variable
        `ANSIBLE_EDGEOS_TERMINAL_LENGTH' is not set, the default number of 10000 is used. This is a network module and requires
        `connection: network_cli' in order to work properly. For more information please see the L(Network
        Guide,../network/getting_started/index.html).

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= commands
        The commands or ordered set of commands that should be run against the remote device. The output of the command is returned to
        the playbook. If the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is met or the number of
        retries is exceeded.


- interval
        The number of seconds to wait between `retries' of the command.
        [Default: 1]

- match
        Used in conjunction with `wait_for' to create match policy. If set to `all', then all conditions in `wait_for' must be met. If
        set to `any', then only one condition must match.
        (Choices: any, all)[Default: all]

- retries
        Number of times a command should be tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device and evaluated
        against the `wait_for' conditionals.
        [Default: 10]

- wait_for
        Causes the task to wait for a specific condition to be met before moving forward. If the condition is not met before the
        specified number of retries is exceeded, the task will fail.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Tested against EdgeOS 1.9.7
      * Running `show system boot-messages all' will cause the module to hang since EdgeOS is using a custom pager setting to
        display the output of that command.
