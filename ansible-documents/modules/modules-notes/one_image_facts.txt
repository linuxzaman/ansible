        Gather facts about OpenNebula images

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- api_password
        Password of the user to login into OpenNebula RPC server. If not set
        then the value of the `ONE_PASSWORD' environment variable is used.
        [Default: (null)]

- api_url
        URL of the OpenNebula RPC server.
        It is recommended to use HTTPS so that the username/password are not
        transferred over the network unencrypted.
        If not set then the value of the `ONE_URL' environment variable is used.
        [Default: (null)]

- api_username
        Name of the user to login into the OpenNebula RPC server. If not set
        then the value of the `ONE_USERNAME' environment variable is used.
        [Default: (null)]

- ids
        A list of images ids whose facts you want to gather.
        (Aliases: id)[Default: (null)]

- name
        A `name' of the image whose facts will be gathered.
        If the `name' begins with '~' the `name' will be used as regex pattern
        which restricts the list of images (whose facts will be returned) whose names match specified regex.
        Also, if the `name' begins with '~*' case-insensitive matching will be performed.
        See examples for more details.
        [Default: (null)]
