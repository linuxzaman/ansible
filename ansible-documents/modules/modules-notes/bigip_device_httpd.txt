> BIGIP_DEVICE_HTTPD    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_httpd.py)

        Manages HTTPD related settings on the BIG-IP. These settings are interesting to change when you want to set GUI timeouts and
        other TMUI related settings.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

        To specify all addresses, use the value `all'.
        IP address can be specified, such as 172.27.1.10.
        IP rangees can be specified, such as 172.27.*.* or 172.27.0.0/255.255.0.0.

NOTES:
      * Requires the requests Python package on the host. This is as easy as `pip install requests'.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
