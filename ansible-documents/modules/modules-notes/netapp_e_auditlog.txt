= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- force

        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- full_policy
        Specifies what audit-log should do once the number of entries approach the record limit.
        (Choices: overWrite, preventSystemAccess)[Default: overWrite]

- log_level
        Filters the log messages according to the specified log level selection.
        (Choices: all, writeOnly)[Default: writeOnly]

- log_path
        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging.
        [Default: (null)]

        [Default: 50000]

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- threshold
        This is the memory full percent threshold that audit-log will start issuing warning messages.

NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * This module is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v3.0 and higher.
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
