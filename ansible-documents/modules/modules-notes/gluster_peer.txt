> GLUSTER_PEER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/storage/glusterfs/gluster_peer.py)

        Create or diminish a GlusterFS trusted storage pool. A set of nodes can be added into an existing trusted storage pool or a new
        storage pool can be formed. Or, nodes can be removed from an existing trusted storage pool.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- force
        Applicable only while removing the nodes from the pool. gluster will refuse to detach a node from the pool if any one of the node
        is down, in such cases force can be used.
        [Default: false]
        type: bool

= nodes
        List of nodes that have to be probed into the pool.


= state
        Determines whether the nodes should be attached to the pool or removed from the pool. If the state is present, nodes will be
        attached to the pool. If state is absent, nodes will be detached from the pool.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * This module does not support check mode.
