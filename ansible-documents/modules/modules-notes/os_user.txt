> OS_USER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/openstack/os_user.py)

        Manage OpenStack Identity users. Users can be created, updated or deleted using this module. A user will be updated if `name'
        matches an existing user and `state' is present. The value for `name' cannot be updated without deleting and re-creating the
        user.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- api_timeout
        How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests
        library.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- auth
        Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default `password' plugin, this
        would contain `auth_url', `username', `password', `project_name' and any information about domains (for example,
        `os_user_domain_name' or `os_project_domain_name') if the cloud supports them. For other plugins, this param will need to contain
        whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud is provided or OpenStack OS_*
        environment variables are present.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict

- auth_type
        Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be
        indicated here and the contents of the `auth' parameter should be updated accordingly.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- availability_zone
        Ignored. Present for backwards compatibility
        [Default: (null)]

- ca_cert
        A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
        (Aliases: cacert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_cert
        A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
        (Aliases: cert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_key
        A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
        (Aliases: key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- cloud
        Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If `cloud' is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an
        OpenStack clouds.yaml file. Provides default values for `auth' and `auth_type'. This parameter is not needed if `auth' is
        provided or if OpenStack OS_* environment variables are present. If `cloud' is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration
        like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: raw

- default_project
        Project name or ID that the user should be associated with by default
        [Default: (null)]

- description
        Description about the user
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- domain
        Domain to create the user in if the cloud supports domains
        [Default: (null)]

- email
        Email address for the user
        [Default: (null)]

- enabled
        Is the user enabled
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- interface
        Endpoint URL type to fetch from the service catalog.
        (Aliases: endpoint_type)(Choices: admin, internal, public)[Default: public]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= name
        Username for the user


- password
        Password for the user
        [Default: (null)]

- region_name
        Name of the region.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        Should the resource be present or absent.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- timeout
        How long should ansible wait for the requested resource.
        [Default: 180]
        type: int

- update_password
        `always' will attempt to update password.  `on_create' will only set the password for newly created users.
        (Choices: always, on_create)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

- validate_certs
        Whether or not SSL API requests should be verified.
        Before Ansible 2.3 this defaulted to `yes'.
        (Aliases: verify)[Default: False]
        type: bool

- wait
        Should ansible wait until the requested resource is complete.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as `OS_USERNAME' may be used instead of providing explicit values.
      * Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in
        /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment
        variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
        https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/


REQUIREMENTS:  openstacksdk, python >= 2.7
