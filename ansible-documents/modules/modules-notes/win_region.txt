OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- copy_settings
        This will copy the current format and location values to new user profiles and the welcome screen. This will only run if
        `location', `format' or `unicode_language' has resulted in a change. If this process runs then it will always result in a change.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- format
        The language format to set for the current user, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
        us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx for a list of culture names to use.
        This needs to be set if `location' or `unicode_language' is not set.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- location
        The location to set for the current user, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374073.aspx for a list of GeoIDs you can
        use and what location it relates to.
        This needs to be set if `format' or `unicode_language' is not set.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- unicode_language
        The unicode language format to set for all users, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
        us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx for a list of culture names to use.
        This needs to be set if `location' or `format' is not set. After setting this value a reboot is required for it to take effect.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
