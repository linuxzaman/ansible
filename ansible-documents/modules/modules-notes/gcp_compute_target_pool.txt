> GCP_COMPUTE_TARGET_POOL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gcp_compute_target_pool.py)

        Represents a TargetPool resource, used for Load Balancing.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- backup_pool
        This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its
        failoverRatio field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].
        backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy
        instances in the primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the
        backup pool.
        In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will
        be directed back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best
        effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.
        This field represents a link to a TargetPool resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_target_pool task and then set this backup_pool field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
        [Default: (null)]

- description
        An optional description of this resource.
        [Default: (null)]

- failover_ratio
        This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a
        backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be in [0, 1].
        If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the
        healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to
        the backup pool.
        In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back
        to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all
        instances when no instance is healthy.
        [Default: (null)]

- health_check
        A reference to a HttpHealthCheck resource.
        A member instance in this pool is considered healthy if and only if the health checks pass. If not specified it means all member
        instances will be considered healthy at all times.
        This field represents a link to a HttpHealthCheck resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a
        dictionary with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_http_health_check task and then set this health_check field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
        [Default: (null)]

- instances
        A list of virtual machine instances serving this pool.
        They must live in zones contained in the same region as this pool.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
        means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
        except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= region
        The region where the target pool resides.


- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- session_affinity
        Session affinity option. Must be one of these values: - NONE: Connections from the same client IP may go to any instance in the
        pool.
        - CLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.
        - CLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while
        that instance remains healthy.
        (Choices: NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO)[Default: (null)]

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
