> FIND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/files/find.py)

        Return a list of files based on specific criteria. Multiple criteria are AND'd together. For Windows targets, use the [win_find]
        module instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- age
        Select files whose age is equal to or greater than the specified time.
        Use a negative age to find files equal to or less than the specified time.
        You can choose seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks by specifying the first letter of any of those words (e.g., "1w").
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- age_stamp
        Choose the file property against which we compare age.
        (Choices: atime, ctime, mtime)[Default: mtime]
        type: str

- contains
        One or more regex patterns which should be matched against the file content.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- depth
        Set the maximum number of levels to decend into.
        Setting recurse to `no' will override this value, which is effectively depth 1.
        Default is unlimited depth.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.6

- excludes
        One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by `use_regex' option.
        Items whose basenames match an `excludes' pattern are culled from `patterns' matches. Multiple patterns can be specified using a
        list.
        (Aliases: exclude)[Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.5

- file_type
        Type of file to select.
        The 'link' and 'any' choices were added in Ansible 2.3.
        (Choices: any, directory, file, link)[Default: file]
        type: str

- follow
        Set this to `yes' to follow symlinks in path for systems with python 2.6+.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- get_checksum
        Set this to `yes' to retrieve a file's SHA1 checksum.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- hidden
        Set this to `yes' to include hidden files, otherwise they will be ignored.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= paths
        List of paths of directories to search. All paths must be fully qualified.
        (Aliases: name, path)
        type: list

- patterns
        One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by `use_regex' option.
        The patterns restrict the list of files to be returned to those whose basenames match at least one of the patterns specified.
        Multiple patterns can be specified using a list.
        This parameter expects a list, which can be either comma separated or YAML. If any of the patterns contain a comma, make sure to
        put them in a list to avoid splitting the patterns in undesirable ways.
        (Aliases: pattern)[Default: *]
        type: list

- recurse
        If target is a directory, recursively descend into the directory looking for files.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- size
        Select files whose size is equal to or greater than the specified size.
        Use a negative size to find files equal to or less than the specified size.
        Unqualified values are in bytes but b, k, m, g, and t can be appended to specify bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and
        terabytes, respectively.
        Size is not evaluated for directories.
        [Default: (null)]

- use_regex
        If `no', the patterns are file globs (shell).
        If `yes', they are python regexes.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
