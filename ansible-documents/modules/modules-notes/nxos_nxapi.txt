> NXOS_NXAPI    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/nxos/nxos_nxapi.py)

        Configures the NXAPI feature on devices running Cisco NXOS.  The NXAPI feature is absent from the configuration by default.
        Since this module manages the NXAPI feature it only supports the use of the `Cli' transport.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- http
        Controls the operating state of the HTTP protocol as one of the underlying transports for NXAPI.  By default, NXAPI will enable
        the HTTP transport when the feature is first configured.  To disable the use of the HTTP transport, set the value of this
        argument to False.
        (Aliases: enable_http)[Default: True]
        type: bool

- http_port
        Configure the port with which the HTTP server will listen on for requests.  By default, NXAPI will bind the HTTP service to the
        standard HTTP port 80.  This argument accepts valid port values in the range of 1 to 65535.
        [Default: 80]

- https
        Controls the operating state of the HTTPS protocol as one of the underlying transports for NXAPI.  By default, NXAPI will disable
        the HTTPS transport when the feature is first configured.  To enable the use of the HTTPS transport, set the value of this
        argument to True.
        (Aliases: enable_https)[Default: False]
        type: bool

- https_port
        Configure the port with which the HTTPS server will listen on for requests.  By default, NXAPI will bind the HTTPS service to the
        standard HTTPS port 443.  This argument accepts valid port values in the range of 1 to 65535.
        [Default: 443]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).

            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,

            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return

- sandbox
        The NXAPI feature provides a web base UI for developers for entering commands.  This feature is initially disabled when the NXAPI
        feature is configured for the first time.  When the `sandbox' argument is set to True, the developer sandbox URL will accept
        requests and when the value is set to False, the sandbox URL is unavailable. This is supported on NX-OS 7K series.
        (Aliases: enable_sandbox)[Default: False]
        type: bool

- ssl_strong_ciphers
        Controls the use of whether strong or weak ciphers are configured. By default, this feature is disabled and weak ciphers are
        configured.  To enable the use of strong ciphers, set the value of this argument to True.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7

- state
        The `state' argument controls whether or not the NXAPI feature is configured on the remote device.  When the value is `present'
        the NXAPI feature configuration is present in the device running-config.  When the values is `absent' the feature configuration
        is removed from the running-config.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- tlsv1_0
        Controls the use of the Transport Layer Security version 1.0 is configured.  By default, this feature is enabled.  To disable the
        use of TLSV1.0, set the value of this argument to True.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7

- tlsv1_1

        use of TLSV1.1, set the value of this argument to True.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7

- tlsv1_2
        Controls the use of the Transport Layer Security version 1.2 is configured.  By default, this feature is disabled.  To enable the
