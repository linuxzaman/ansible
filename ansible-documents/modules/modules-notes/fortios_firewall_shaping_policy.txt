> FORTIOS_FIREWALL_SHAPING_POLICY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_firewall_shaping_policy.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to configure firewall feature and shaping_policy
        category. Examples includes all options and need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2
