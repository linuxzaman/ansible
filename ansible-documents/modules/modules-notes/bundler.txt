        Manage installation and Gem version dependencies for Ruby using the Bundler gem

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- binstub_directory
        Only applies if state is `present'. Specifies the directory to install any gem bins files to. When executed the bin files will
        run within the context of the Gemfile and fail if any required gem dependencies are not installed. If `chdir' is set then this
        path is relative to `chdir'
        [Default: (null)]

- chdir
        The directory to execute the bundler commands from. This directoy needs to contain a valid Gemfile or .bundle/ directory
        [Default: temporary working directory]

- clean
        Only applies if state is `present'. If set removes any gems on the target host that are not in the gemfile
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- deployment_mode
        Only applies if state is `present'. If set it will install gems in ./vendor/bundle instead of the default location. Requires a
        Gemfile.lock file to have been created prior
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- exclude_groups
        A list of Gemfile groups to exclude during operations. This only applies when state is `present'. Bundler considers this a
        'remembered' property for the Gemfile and will automatically exclude groups in future operations even if `exclude_groups' is not
        set
        [Default: (null)]

- executable
        The path to the bundler executable
        [Default: (null)]

- extra_args
        A space separated string of additional commands that can be applied to the Bundler command. Refer to the Bundler documentation
        for more information
        [Default: (null)]

- gem_path
        Only applies if state is `present'. Specifies the directory to install the gems into. If `chdir' is set then this path is
        relative to `chdir'
        [Default: RubyGems gem paths]

- gemfile
        Only applies if state is `present'. The path to the gemfile to use to install gems.
        [Default: Gemfile in current directory]

- local
        If set only installs gems from the cache on the target host
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- state
        The desired state of the Gem bundle. `latest' updates gems to the most recent, acceptable version
        (Choices: present, latest)[Default: present]

- user_install
        Only applies if state is `present'. Installs gems in the local user's cache or for all users
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
