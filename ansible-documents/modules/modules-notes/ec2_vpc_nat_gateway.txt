> EC2_VPC_NAT_GATEWAY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/amazon/ec2_vpc_nat_gateway.py)

        Ensure the state of AWS VPC NAT Gateways based on their id, allocation and subnet ids.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- allocation_id
        The id of the elastic IP allocation. If this is not passed and the eip_address is not passed. An EIP is generated for this NAT
        Gateway.
        [Default: (null)]

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_token
        Optional unique token to be used during create to ensure idempotency. When specifying this option, ensure you specify the
        eip_address parameter as well otherwise any subsequent runs will fail.
        [Default: (null)]

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- eip_address
        The elastic IP address of the EIP you want attached to this NAT Gateway. If this is not passed and the allocation_id is not
        passed, an EIP is generated for this NAT Gateway.
        [Default: (null)]

- if_exist_do_not_create
        if a NAT Gateway exists already in the subnet_id, then do not create a new one.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- nat_gateway_id
        The id AWS dynamically allocates to the NAT Gateway on creation. This is required when the absent option is present.
        [Default: (null)]

- profile
        Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- region
        The AWS region to use. If not specified then the value of the AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION environment variable, if any, is used. See
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region
        (Aliases: aws_region, ec2_region)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- release_eip
        Deallocate the EIP from the VPC.
        Option is only valid with the absent state.
        You should use this with the wait option. Since you can not release an address while a delete operation is happening.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- security_token
        AWS STS security token. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable is used.
        (Aliases: access_token)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- state
        Ensure NAT Gateway is present or absent.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subnet_id
        The id of the subnet to create the NAT Gateway in. This is required with the present option.
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        When set to "no", SSL certificates will not be validated for boto versions >= 2.6.0.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.5

- wait
        Wait for operation to complete before returning.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- wait_timeout
        How many seconds to wait for an operation to complete before timing out.
        [Default: 300]


NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  boto, boto3, botocore, python >= 2.6
