> NXOS_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/nxos/nxos_facts.py)

        Collects facts from Cisco Nexus devices running the NX-OS operating system.  Fact collection is supported over both Cli and Nxapi
        transports.  This module prepends all of the base network fact keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always
        collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        hardware, config, legacy, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with
        an initial `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: !config]
        version_added: 2.2

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).

        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.

            version_added: 2.5.3
          authorize:
            default: false
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
            version_added: 2.5.3
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              is a common argument used for either `cli' or `nxapi' transports. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 0 (use common port)
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,
              http=80, https=443).
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              argument is only used for the `cli' transport. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return
              on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).

            description:
            - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.  The

              ignored.

          use_ssl:

            description:
            - Configures the `transport' to use SSL if set to `yes' only when the `transport=nxapi',
              otherwise this value is ignored.
            type: bool
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME' will
              be used instead.

            description:
            - If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on
              personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
              argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
