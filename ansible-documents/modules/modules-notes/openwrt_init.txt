> OPENWRT_INIT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/openwrt_init.py)

        Controls OpenWrt services on remote hosts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- enabled
        Whether the service should start on boot. *At least one of state and enabled are required.*
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        Name of the service.
        (Aliases: service)

- pattern
        If the service does not respond to the 'running' command, name a substring to look for as would be found in the output of the
        `ps' command as a stand-in for a 'running' result.  If the string is found, the service will be assumed to be running.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        `started'/`stopped' are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary. `restarted' will always bounce the
        service. `reloaded' will always reload.
        (Choices: started, stopped, restarted, reloaded)[Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * One option other than name is required.
