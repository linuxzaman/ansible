> EOS_LINKAGG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/eos/eos_linkagg.py)

        This module provides declarative management of link aggregation groups on Arista EOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of link aggregation definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- group
        Channel-group number for the port-channel Link aggregation group. Range 1-2000.
        [Default: (null)]

- members
        List of members of the link aggregation group.
        [Default: (null)]

- min_links
        Minimum number of ports required up before bringing up the link aggregation group.
        [Default: (null)]

- mode
        Mode of the link aggregation group.
        (Choices: active, on, passive)[Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
