  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- api_timeout
        How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests
        library.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- auth
        Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default `password' plugin, this
        would contain `auth_url', `username', `password', `project_name' and any information about domains (for example,
        `os_user_domain_name' or `os_project_domain_name') if the cloud supports them. For other plugins, this param will need to contain
        whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud is provided or OpenStack OS_*
        environment variables are present.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict

- auth_type
        Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be
        indicated here and the contents of the `auth' parameter should be updated accordingly.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- availability_zone
        Ignored. Present for backwards compatibility
        [Default: (null)]

- ca_cert
        A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
        (Aliases: cacert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_cert
        A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
        (Aliases: cert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_key
        A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
        (Aliases: key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- cloud
        Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If `cloud' is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an
        OpenStack clouds.yaml file. Provides default values for `auth' and `auth_type'. This parameter is not needed if `auth' is
        provided or if OpenStack OS_* environment variables are present. If `cloud' is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration
        like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: raw

- fixed_address
        To which fixed IP of server the floating IP address should be attached to.
        [Default: (null)]

- floating_ip_address
        A floating IP address to attach or to detach. Required only if `state' is absent. When `state' is present can be used to specify
        a IP address to attach.
        [Default: (null)]

- interface
        Endpoint URL type to fetch from the service catalog.
        (Aliases: endpoint_type)(Choices: admin, internal, public)[Default: public]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

- nat_destination
        The name or id of a neutron private network that the fixed IP to attach floating IP is on
        (Aliases: fixed_network, internal_network)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

- network
        The name or ID of a neutron external network or a nova pool name.
        [Default: (null)]

- purge
        When `state' is absent, indicates whether or not to delete the floating IP completely, or only detach it from the server. Default
        is to detach only.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.1

- region_name
        Name of the region.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- reuse
        When `state' is present, and `floating_ip_address' is not present, this parameter can be used to specify whether we should try to
        reuse a floating IP address already allocated to the project.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

= server
        The name or ID of the instance to which the IP address should be assigned.


- state
        Should the resource be present or absent.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- timeout
        Time to wait for an IP address to appear as attached. See wait.
        [Default: 60]
        type: int

- validate_certs
        Whether or not SSL API requests should be verified.
        Before Ansible 2.3 this defaulted to `yes'.
        (Aliases: verify)[Default: False]
        type: bool

- wait
        When attaching a floating IP address, specify whether we should wait for it to appear as attached.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as `OS_USERNAME' may be used instead of providing explicit values.
      * Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in
        /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment
        variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
        https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/


REQUIREMENTS:  openstacksdk, python >= 2.7

EXAMPLES:

# Assign a floating IP to the fist interface of `cattle001` from an exiting
# external network or nova pool. A new floating IP from the first available
# external network is allocated to the project.
- os_floating_ip:
     cloud: dguerri
     server: cattle001

# Assign a new floating IP to the instance fixed ip `192.0.2.3` of
# `cattle001`. If a free floating IP is already allocated to the project, it is
# reused; if not, a new one is created.
- os_floating_ip:
     cloud: dguerri
     state: present
     reuse: yes
     server: cattle001
     network: ext_net
     fixed_address: 192.0.2.3
     wait: true
     timeout: 180

# Assign a new floating IP from the network `ext_net` to the instance fixed
# ip in network `private_net` of `cattle001`.
- os_floating_ip:
     cloud: dguerri
     state: present
     server: cattle001
     network: ext_net
     nat_destination: private_net
     wait: true
     timeout: 180

# Detach a floating IP address from a server
- os_floating_ip:
     cloud: dguerri
     state: absent
     floating_ip_address: 203.0.113.2
