> EDGEOS_CONFIG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/edgeos/edgeos_config.py)

        This module provides configuration file management of EdgeOS devices. It provides arguments for managing both the configuration
        file and state of the active configuration. All configuration statements are based on `set` and `delete` commands in the device
        configuration. This is a network module and requires the `connection: network_cli' in order to work properly. For more
        information please see the L(Network Guide,../network/getting_started/index.html).

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- backup
        The `backup' argument will backup the current device's active configuration to the Ansible control host prior to making any
        changes. If the `backup_options' value is not given, the backup file will be located in the backup folder in the playbook root
        directory or role root directory if the playbook is part of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- backup_options
        This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when
        `backup' is set to `yes', if `backup' is set to `no' this option will be silently ignored.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          dir_path:
            description:
            - This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup
              configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
              first created and the filename is either the value of `filename' or default
              filename as described in `filename' options description. If the path value
              is not given in that case a `backup' directory will be created in the current
              working directory and backup configuration will be copied in `filename' within
              `backup' directory.
            type: path
          filename:
            description:
            - The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename
              is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
              in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.8

- comment
        Allows a commit description to be specified to be included when the configuration is committed. If the configuration is not
        changed or committed, this argument is ignored.
        [Default: configured by edgeos_config]

- config
        The `config' argument specifies the base configuration to use to compare against the desired configuration. If this value is not
        specified, the module will automatically retrieve the current active configuration from the remote device.
        [Default: (null)]

- lines
        The ordered set of configuration lines to be managed and compared with the existing configuration on the remote device.
        [Default: (null)]

- match
        The `match' argument controls the method used to match against the current active configuration. By default, the desired config
        is matched against the active config and the deltas are loaded. If the `match' argument is set to `none' the active configuration
        is ignored and the configuration is always loaded.
        (Choices: line, none)[Default: line]

- save
        The `save' argument controls whether or not changes made to the active configuration are saved to disk. This is independent of
        committing the config. When set to `True', the active configuration is saved.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- src
        The `src' argument specifies the path to the source config file to load. The source config file can either be in bracket format
        or set format. The source file can include Jinja2 template variables.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Tested against EdgeOS 1.9.7
      * Setting `ANSIBLE_PERSISTENT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT' to 30 is recommended since the save command can take longer than the default
        of 10 seconds on some EdgeOS hardware.
