> NETACT_CM_COMMAND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/netact/netact_cm_command.py)

        netact_cm_command can be used to run various configuration management operations. This module requires that the target hosts have
        Nokia NetAct network management system installed. Module will access the Configurator command line interface in NetAct to upload
        network configuration to NetAct, run configuration export, plan import and configuration provision operations To set the scope of
        the operation, define Distinguished Name (DN) or Working Set (WS) or Maintenance Region (MR) as input

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- DN
        Sets the exact scope of the operation in form of a list of managed object Distinguished Names (DN) in the network. A single DN or
        a list of DNs can be given (comma separated list without spaces). Alternatively, if DN or a list of DNs is not given, working set
        (WS) or Maintenance Region (MR) must be provided as parameter to set the scope of operation.
        [Default: (null)]

- MR
        Sets the scope of the operation to network elements assigned to a Maintenance Region (MR) Value can be set as MR IDs including
        the Maintenance Region Collection (MRC) information (for example MRC-FIN1/MR-Hel). Multiple MRs can be given (comma-separated
        list without spaces) The value of this parameter is searched through MR IDs under given MRC. If there is no match, then it is
        searched from all MR names. Alternatively, if MR ID or a list or MR IDs is not given, Distinguished Name (DN) or Working Set (WS)
        must be provided as parameter to set the scope of operation.
        [Default: (null)]

- WS
        Sets the scope of the operation to use one or more pre-defined working sets (WS) in NetAct. A working set contains network
        elements selected by user according to defined criteria. A single WS name, or multiple WSs can be provided (comma-separated list
        without spaces). Alternatively, if a WS name or a list of WSs is not given, Distinguished Name (DN) or Maintenance Region(MR)
        must be provided as parameter to set the scope of operation.
        [Default: (null)]

- backupPlanName
        Specifies a backup plan name
        [Default: (null)]

- createBackupPlan
        Specifies if backup plan generation is enabled.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- extra_opts
        Extra options to be set for operations. Check Configuration Management > Configuration Management Operating Procedures > Command
        Line Operations in Nokia NetAct user documentation for further information for extra options.
        [Default: (null)]

- fileFormat
        Indicates file format.
        (Choices: RAML2, CSV, XLSX)[Default: (null)]

- fileName
        Specifies a file name. Valid for Import and Export operations.
        [Default: (null)]

- inputFile
        Specifies full path to plan file location for the import operation. This parameter (inputFile) or the fileName parameter must be
        filled. If both are present then the inputFile is used.
        [Default: (null)]

= operation
        Supported operations allow user to upload actual configuration from the network, to import and provision prepared plans, or
        export reference or actual configuration for planning purposes. Provision_Mass_Modification enables provisioning the same
        parameters to multiple network elements. This operation supports modifications only to one object class at a time. With this
        option NetAct Configurator creates and provisions a plan to the network with the given scope and options.
        (Aliases: op)(Choices: upload, provision, import, export, Provision_Mass_Modification)

- opsName
        user specified operation name
        [Default: (null)]

- planName
        Specifies a plan name.
        [Default: (null)]

- typeOption
        Specifies the type of the export operation.
        (Aliases: type)(Choices: plan, actual, reference, template, siteTemplate)[Default: (null)]

- verbose
        NetAct Configurator will print more info
        [Default: (null)]
