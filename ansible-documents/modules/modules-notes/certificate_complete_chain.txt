> CERTIFICATE_COMPLETE_CHAIN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/crypto/certificate_complete_chain.py)

        This module completes a given chain of certificates in PEM format by finding intermediate certificates from a given set of
        certificates, until it finds a root certificate in another given set of certificates. This can for example be used to find the
        root certificate for a certificate chain returned by [acme_certificate]. Note that this module does `not' check for validity of
        the chains. It only checks that issuer and subject match, and that the signature is correct. It ignores validity dates and key
        usage completely. If you need to verify that a generated chain is valid, please use `openssl verify ...'.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= input_chain
        A concatenated set of certificates in PEM format forming a chain.
        The module will try to complete this chain.

        type: str

- intermediate_certificates
        A list of filenames or directories.
        A filename is assumed to point to a file containing one or more certificates in PEM format. All certificates in this file will be
        added to the set of root certificates.
        If a directory name is given, all files in the directory and its subdirectories will be scanned and tried to be parsed as
        concatenated certificates in PEM format.
        Symbolic links will be followed.
        [Default: []]
        type: list

= root_certificates
        A list of filenames or directories.
        A filename is assumed to point to a file containing one or more certificates in PEM format. All certificates in this file will be
        added to the set of root certificates.
        If a directory name is given, all files in the directory and its subdirectories will be scanned and tried to be parsed as
        concatenated certificates in PEM format.
        Symbolic links will be followed.
