  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- configure_priv
        Regular expression to restrict configure actions on a resource for the specified vhost.
        By default all actions are restricted.
        This option will be ignored when permissions option is used.
        [Default: ^$]

- force
        Deletes and recreates the user.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- node
        erlang node name of the rabbit we wish to configure
        [Default: rabbit]
        version_added: 1.2

- password
        Password of user to add.
        To change the password of an existing user, you must also specify `update_password=always'.
        [Default: (null)]

- permissions
        a list of dicts, each dict contains vhost, configure_priv, write_priv, and read_priv, and represents a permission rule for that
        vhost.
        This option should be preferable when you care about all permissions of the user.
        You should use vhost, configure_priv, write_priv, and read_priv options instead if you care about permissions for just some
        vhosts.
        [Default: []]

- read_priv
        Regular expression to restrict configure actions on a resource for the specified vhost.
        By default all actions are restricted.

        [Default: ^$]

        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- tags
        User tags specified as comma delimited
        [Default: (null)]

- update_password

        (Choices: on_create, always)[Default: on_create]
        version_added: 2.6
