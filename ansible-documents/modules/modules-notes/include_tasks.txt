> INCLUDE_TASKS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/utilities/logic/include_tasks.py)

        Includes a file with a list of tasks to be executed in the current playbook.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- apply
        Accepts a hash of task keywords (e.g. `tags', `become') that will be applied to the tasks within the include.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.7

- file
        The name of the imported file is specified directly without any other option.
        Unlike [import_tasks], most keywords, including loop, with_items, and conditionals, apply to this statement.
        The do until loop is not supported on [include_tasks].
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.7

- free-form
        Supplying a file name via free-form `- include_tasks: file.yml' of a file to be included is the equivalent of specifying an
        argument of `file'.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * This is a core feature of the Ansible, rather than a module, and cannot be overridden like a module.
