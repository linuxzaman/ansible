        Specify a port as a BPDU filter port.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- bpdu_protection
        Configure BPDU protection on an edge port. This function prevents network flapping caused by attack packets.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- cost
        Set the path cost of the current port. The default instance is 0.
        [Default: (null)]

- edged_port
        Set the current port as an edge port.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- interface
        Interface name. If the value is `all', will apply configuration to all interfaces. if the value is a special name, only support

        Enable root protection on the current port.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- state
        Specify desired state of the resource.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- stp_converge
        STP convergence mode. Fast means set STP aging mode to Fast. Normal means set STP aging mode to Normal.
        (Choices: fast, normal)[Default: (null)]

- stp_enable
        Enable or disable STP on a switch.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- stp_mode
        Set an operation mode for the current MSTP process. The mode can be STP, RSTP, or MSTP.
        (Choices: stp, rstp, mstp)[Default: (null)]

- tc_protection
        Configure the TC BPDU protection function for an MSTP process.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- tc_protection_interval
        Set the time the MSTP device takes to handle the maximum number of TC BPDUs and immediately refresh forwarding entries. The value
        is an integer ranging from 1 to 600, in seconds.
        [Default: (null)]

- tc_protection_threshold
        Set the maximum number of TC BPDUs that the MSTP can handle. The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 255. The default value is
