        Add or remove a database on a Webfaction host. Further documentation at https://github.com/quentinsf/ansible-webfaction.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= login_name
        The webfaction account to use


= login_password
        The webfaction password to use


- machine
        The machine name to use (optional for accounts with only one machine)
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        The name of the database


- password
        The password for the new database user.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Whether the database should exist
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

= type
        The type of database to create.
        (Choices: mysql, postgresql)


NOTES:
      * You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the
        remote webfaction API. The location is not important. However, running them on multiple hosts `simultaneously' is best
        avoided. If you don't specify `localhost' as your host, you may want to add `serial: 1' to the plays.
      * See `the webfaction API <https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/>`_ for more info.

EXAMPLES:

# This will also create a default DB user with the same
  # name as the database, and the specified password.

  - name: Create a database
    webfaction_db:
      name: "{{webfaction_user}}_db1"
      password: mytestsql
      type: mysql
      login_name: "{{webfaction_user}}"
      login_password: "{{webfaction_passwd}}"
      machine: "{{webfaction_machine}}"

  # Note that, for symmetry's sake, deleting a database using
  # 'state: absent' will also delete the matching user.
