> NETAPP_E_SYSLOG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/storage/netapp/netapp_e_syslog.py)

        Allow the syslog settings to be configured for an individual E-Series storage-system

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        The syslog server's IPv4 address or a fully qualified hostname.
        All existing syslog configurations will be removed when `state=absent' and `address=None'.
        [Default: (null)]

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- components
        The e-series logging components define the specific logs to transfer to the syslog server.
        At the time of writing, 'auditLog' is the only logging component but more may become available.
        [Default: [u'auditLog']]

- log_path
        This argument specifies a local path for logging purposes.
        [Default: (null)]

- port
        This is the port the syslog server is using.
        [Default: 514]

- protocol
        This is the transmission protocol the syslog server's using to receive syslog messages.
        (Choices: udp, tcp, tls)[Default: udp]

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- state
        Add or remove the syslog server configuration for E-Series storage array.
        Existing syslog server configuration will be removed or updated when its address matches `address'.
        Fully qualified hostname that resolve to an IPv4 address that matches `address' will not be treated as a match.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- test
        This forces a test syslog message to be sent to the stated syslog server.
        Only attempts transmission when `state=present'.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * This API is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v2.12 (bundled with SANtricity OS 11.40.2) and
        higher.
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
