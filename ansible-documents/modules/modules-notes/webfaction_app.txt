        The machine name to use (optional for accounts with only one machine)
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        The name of the application


- port_open
        IF the port should be opened
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- state
        Whether the application should exist
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

= type
        The type of application to create. See the Webfaction docs at https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/apps.html for a list.



NOTES:
      * You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the
        remote webfaction API. The location is not important. However, running them on multiple hosts `simultaneously' is best
        avoided. If you don't specify `localhost' as your host, you may want to add `serial: 1' to the plays.
      * See `the webfaction API <https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/>`_ for more info.
