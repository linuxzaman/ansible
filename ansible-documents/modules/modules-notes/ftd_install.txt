> FTD_INSTALL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/ftd/ftd_install.py)

        Provisioning module for FTD devices that installs ROMMON image (if needed) and FTD pkg image on the firewall. Can be used with
        `httpapi` and `local` connection types. The `httpapi` is preferred, the `local` connection should be used only when the device
        cannot be accessed via REST API.
