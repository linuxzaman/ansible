  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- backup
        Passes `--backup --version-control=numbered' to patch, producing numbered backup copies.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0

- basedir
        Path of a base directory in which the patch file will be applied.
        May be omitted when `dest' option is specified, otherwise required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- binary
        Setting to `yes' will disable patch's heuristic for transforming CRLF line endings into LF.
        Line endings of src and dest must match.
        If set to `no', `patch' will replace CRLF in `src' files on POSIX.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0

- dest
        Path of the file on the remote machine to be patched.
        The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from the patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can
        specified with this option.
        (Aliases: originalfile)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- remote_src
        If `no', it will search for src at originating/master machine, if `yes' it will go to the remote/target machine for the `src'.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= src
        Path of the patch file as accepted by the GNU patch tool. If `remote_src' is 'no', the patch source file is looked up from the
        module's `files' directory.
        (Aliases: patchfile)
        type: path

- state
        Whether the patch should be applied or reverted.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6

- strip
        Number that indicates the smallest prefix containing leading slashes that will be stripped from each file name found in the patch
        file.
        For more information see the strip parameter of the GNU patch tool.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int


NOTES:
      * This module requires GNU `patch' utility to be installed on the remote host.
