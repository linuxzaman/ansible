> EXOS_COMMAND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/exos/exos_command.py)

        Sends arbitrary commands to an Extreme EXOS device and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument
        that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met. This
        module does not support running configuration commands. Please use [exos_config] to configure EXOS devices.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= commands
        List of commands to send to the remote EXOS device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is
        returned. If the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of
        retries has expired.


- interval
        Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions,
        the interval indicates how long to wait before trying the command again.
        [Default: 1]

- match
        The `match' argument is used in conjunction with the `wait_for' argument to specify the match policy.  Valid values are `all' or
        `any'.  If the value is set to `all' then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If the value is set to `any' then
        only one of the values must be satisfied.
        (Choices: any, all)[Default: all]

- retries
        Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device
        every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for' conditions.
        [Default: 10]

- wait_for
        List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving
        forward. If the conditional is not true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing `command', `answer'
        and `prompt'. See examples.
