> NET_SYSTEM    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/system/net_system.py)

        This module provides declarative management of node system attributes on network devices.  It provides an option to configure
        host system parameters or remove those parameters from the device active configuration.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- domain_name
        Configure the IP domain name on the remote device to the provided value. Value should be in the dotted name form and will be
        appended to the `hostname' to create a fully-qualified domain name.
        [Default: (null)]

- domain_search
        Provides the list of domain suffixes to append to the hostname for the purpose of doing name resolution. This argument accepts a
        list of names and will be reconciled with the current active configuration on the running node.
        [Default: (null)]

- hostname
        Configure the device hostname parameter. This option takes an ASCII string value.
        [Default: (null)]

- lookup_source
        Provides one or more source interfaces to use for performing DNS lookups.  The interface provided in `lookup_source' must be a
        valid interface configured on the device.
        [Default: (null)]

- name_servers
        List of DNS name servers by IP address to use to perform name resolution lookups.  This argument accepts either a list of DNS
        servers See examples.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the configuration values in the device's current active configuration.  When set to `present', the values should be
        configured in the device active configuration and when set to `absent' the values should not be in the device active
        configuration
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * This module is supported on `ansible_network_os' network platforms. See the :ref:`Network Platform Options
        <platform_options>` for details.
