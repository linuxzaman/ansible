> DOCKER_VOLUME_INFO    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/docker/docker_volume_info.py)

        Performs largely the same function as the "docker volume inspect" CLI subcommand.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- api_version
        The version of the Docker API running on the Docker Host.
        Defaults to the latest version of the API supported by Docker SDK for Python and the docker daemon.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_API_VERSION' will be used instead. If the
        environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.
        (Aliases: docker_api_version)[Default: auto]
        type: str

- ca_cert
        Use a CA certificate when performing server verification by providing the path to a CA certificate file.
        If the value is not specified in the task and the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH' is set, the file `ca.pem' from the
        directory specified in the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH' will be used.
        (Aliases: tls_ca_cert, cacert_path)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- client_cert
        Path to the client's TLS certificate file.
        If the value is not specified in the task and the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH' is set, the file `cert.pem' from the
        directory specified in the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH' will be used.
        (Aliases: tls_client_cert, cert_path)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- client_key
        Path to the client's TLS key file.
        If the value is not specified in the task and the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH' is set, the file `key.pem' from the
        directory specified in the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH' will be used.
        (Aliases: tls_client_key, key_path)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- debug
        Debug mode
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- docker_host
        The URL or Unix socket path used to connect to the Docker API. To connect to a remote host, provide the TCP connection string.
        For example, `tcp://192.0.2.23:2376'. If TLS is used to encrypt the connection, the module will automatically replace `tcp' in
        the connection URL with `https'.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_HOST' will be used instead. If the
        environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.
        (Aliases: docker_url)[Default: unix://var/run/docker.sock]
        type: str

= name
        Name of the volume to inspect.
        (Aliases: volume_name)
        type: str

- ssl_version
        Provide a valid SSL version number. Default value determined by ssl.py module.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_SSL_VERSION' will be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- timeout
        The maximum amount of time in seconds to wait on a response from the API.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_TIMEOUT' will be used instead. If the
        environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.
        [Default: 60]
        type: int

- tls
        Secure the connection to the API by using TLS without verifying the authenticity of the Docker host server. Note that if
        `tls_verify' is set to `yes' as well, it will take precedence.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_TLS' will be used instead. If the
        environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- tls_hostname
        When verifying the authenticity of the Docker Host server, provide the expected name of the server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_TLS_HOSTNAME' will be used instead. If the
        environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.
        [Default: localhost]
        type: str

- validate_certs
        Secure the connection to the API by using TLS and verifying the authenticity of the Docker host server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY' will be used instead. If the
        environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.
        (Aliases: tls_verify)[Default: False]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Connect to the Docker daemon by providing parameters with each task or by defining environment variables. You can define
        `DOCKER_HOST', `DOCKER_TLS_HOSTNAME', `DOCKER_API_VERSION', `DOCKER_CERT_PATH', `DOCKER_SSL_VERSION', `DOCKER_TLS',
        `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY' and `DOCKER_TIMEOUT'. If you are using docker machine, run the script shipped with the product that
        sets up the environment. It will set these variables for you. See https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/machine/ for
        more details.
      * When connecting to Docker daemon with TLS, you might need to install additional Python packages. For the Docker SDK for
        Python, version 2.4 or newer, this can be done by installing `docker[tls]' with [pip].
      * Note that the Docker SDK for Python only allows to specify the path to the Docker configuration for very few functions. In
        general, it will use `$HOME/.docker/config.json' if the `DOCKER_CONFIG' environment variable is not specified, and use
        `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json' otherwise.


REQUIREMENTS:  Docker API >= 1.21, Docker SDK for Python: Please note that the L(docker-py,https://pypi.org/project/docker-py/) Python
        module has been superseded by L(docker,https://pypi.org/project/docker/) (see L(here,https://github.com/docker
        /docker-py/issues/1310) for details). For Python 2.6, `docker-py' must be used. Otherwise, it is recommended to
        install the `docker' Python module. Note that both modules should `not' be installed at the same time. Also note
        that when both modules are installed and one of them is uninstalled, the other might no longer function and a
        reinstall of it is required., L(Docker SDK for Python,https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) >= 1.8.0 (use
        L(docker-py,https://pypi.org/project/docker-py/) for Python 2.6)
