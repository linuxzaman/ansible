        A list of users or groups to add/remove on the User Right.
        These can be in the form DOMAIN\user-group, user-group@DOMAIN.COM for domain users/groups.
        For local users/groups it can be in the form user-group, .\user-group, SERVERNAME\user-group where SERVERNAME is the name of the

      * If the server is domain joined this module can change a right but if a GPO governs this right then the changes won't last.
