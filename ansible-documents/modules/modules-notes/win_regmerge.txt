> WIN_REGMERGE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_regmerge.py)

        Wraps the reg.exe command to import the contents of a registry file. Suitable for use with registry files created using
        [win_template]. Windows registry files have a specific format and must be constructed correctly with carriage return and line
        feed line endings otherwise they will not be merged. Exported registry files often start with a Byte Order Mark which must be
        removed if the file is to templated using [win_template]. Registry file format is described at https://support.microsoft.com/en-
        us/kb/310516 See also [win_template], [win_regedit]

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- compare_key
        The parent key to use when comparing the contents of the registry to the contents of the file.  Needs to be in HKLM or HKCU part
        of registry. Use a PS-Drive style path for example HKLM:\SOFTWARE not HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE If not supplied, or the
        registry key is not found, no comparison will be made, and the module will report changed.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= path
        The full path including file name to the registry file on the remote machine to be merged

        type: path


NOTES:
      * Organise your registry files so that they contain a single root registry key if you want to use the compare_to
        functionality.
      * This module does not force registry settings to be in the state described in the file.  If registry settings have been
        modified externally the module will merge the contents of the file but continue to report differences on subsequent runs.
      * To force registry change, use [win_regedit] with `state=absent' before using `win_regmerge'.
