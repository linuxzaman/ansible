        Configure the rollback feature on remote Nokia devices running the SR OS operating system.  this module provides a stateful
        implementation for managing the configuration of the rollback feature

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- local_max_checkpoints
        The `local_max_checkpoints' argument configures the maximum number of rollback files that can be saved on the devices local
        compact flash.  Valid values for this argument are in the range of 1 to 50
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address

          password:

            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the

        type: dict

- remote_max_checkpoints
        The `remote_max_checkpoints' argument configures the maximum number of rollback files that can be transferred and saved to a

        [Default: (null)]

- rescue_location
        The `rescue_location' specifies the location of the rescue file.  This argument supports any valid local or remote URL as

        [Default: (null)]

- state
        The `state' argument specifies the state of the configuration entries in the devices active configuration.  When the state value
        is set to `true' the configuration is present in the devices active configuration.  When the state value is set to `false' the
