> WIN_POWER_PLAN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_power_plan.py)

        This module will change the power plan of a Windows system to the defined string. Windows defaults to `balanced' which will cause
        CPU throttling. In some cases it can be preferable to change the mode to `high performance' to increase CPU performance.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= name
        String value that indicates the desired power plan.
        The power plan must already be present on the system.
        Commonly there will be options for `balanced' and `high performance'.

        type: str
