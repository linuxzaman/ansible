        This module allows you to work with virtual Link Aggregation Groups (vLAG) related configurations. The operators used are
        overloaded to ensure control over switch vLAG configurations. Apart from the regular device connection related attributes, there
        are four vLAG arguments which are overloaded variables that will perform further configurations. They are vlagArg1, vlagArg2,
        vlagArg3, and vlagArg4. For more details on how to use these arguments, see [Overloaded Variables]. This module uses SSH to
        manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be
        created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= deviceType
        This specifies the type of device where the method is executed. The choices NE1072T,NE1032,NE1032T,NE10032,NE2572 are added since
        Ansible 2.4. The choice NE0152T is added since 2.8
        (Choices: g8272_cnos, g8296_cnos, g8332_cnos, NE0152T, NE1072T, NE1032, NE1032T, NE10032, NE2572)
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

- enablePassword
        Configures the password used to enter Global Configuration command mode on the switch. If the switch does not request this
        password, the parameter is ignored.While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a
        variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no default value will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= host
        This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the
        template is going to be applied. Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an
        abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= outputfile
        This specifies the file path where the output of each command execution is saved. Each command that is specified in the merged
        template file and each response from the device are saved here. Usually the location is the results folder, but you can choose
        another location based on your write permission.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= password
        Configures the password used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the password parameter is used to
        authenticate the SSH session. While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a
        variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no default value will be used.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= username
        Configures the username used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the username parameter is used to
        authenticate the SSH session. While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a
        variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no default value will be used.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= vlagArg1
        This is an overloaded vlag first argument. Usage of this argument can be found is the User Guide referenced above.
        (Choices: enable, auto-recovery, config-consistency, isl, mac-address-table, peer-gateway, priority, startup-delay, tier-id,
        vrrp, instance, hlthchk)[Default: None]

- vlagArg2
        This is an overloaded vlag second argument. Usage of this argument can be found is the User Guide referenced above.
        (Choices: Interval in seconds, disable or strict, Port Aggregation Number, VLAG priority, Delay time in seconds, VLAG tier-id
        value, VLAG instance number, keepalive-attempts, keepalive-interval, retry-interval, peer-ip)[Default: None]

- vlagArg3
        This is an overloaded vlag third argument. Usage of this argument can be found is the User Guide referenced above.
        (Choices: enable or port-aggregation, Number of keepalive attempts, Interval in seconds, Interval in seconds, VLAG health check
        peer IP4 address)[Default: None]

- vlagArg4
        This is an overloaded vlag fourth argument. Usage of this argument can be found is the User Guide referenced above.
        (Choices: Port Aggregation Number, default or management)[Default: None]
