NOTES:
      * This module must run on a windows 10 or Server 2016 host, so ensure your play targets windows hosts, or delegates to a
        windows host.
      * The module does not fail if there are no logged in users to notify.
      * Messages are only sent to the local host where the module is run.
      * You must run this module with async, otherwise it will hang until the expire period has passed.
