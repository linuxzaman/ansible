OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

        type: int

- description
        User created HA group description.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

        When set to `no' the system disables the ha score feature.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

= name

NOTES:
      * This module does not support atomic removal of HA group objects.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
