OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- annotation
        A comma-separated list of keyvalue-pairs of the form `<+/-/:><key>[=<value>]'. A `+' denotes adding an annotation, a `-' denotes
        removing an annotation, and `:' denotes modifying an annotation. If setting or modifying annotations, a value must be provided.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.6

- autoremove
        Remove automatically installed packages which are no longer needed.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2

- cached
        Use local package base instead of fetching an updated one.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- chroot
        Pkg will chroot in the specified environment.
        Can not be used together with `rootdir' or `jail' options.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- jail
        Pkg will execute in the given jail name or id.
        Can not be used together with `chroot' or `rootdir' options.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

= name
        Name or list of names of packages to install/remove.


- pkgsite
        For pkgng versions before 1.1.4, specify packagesite to use for downloading packages. If not specified, use settings from
        `/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf'.
        For newer pkgng versions, specify a the name of a repository configured in `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos'.
        [Default: (null)]

- rootdir
        For pkgng versions 1.5 and later, pkg will install all packages within the specified root directory.
        Can not be used together with `chroot' or `jail' options.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the package.
        Note: "latest" added in 2.7
        (Choices: present, latest, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * When using pkgsite, be careful that already in cache packages won't be downloaded again.
      * When used with a `loop:` each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly
        to the `name` option.
