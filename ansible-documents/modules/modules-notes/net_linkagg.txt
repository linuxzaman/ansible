> NET_LINKAGG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/interface/net_linkagg.py)

        This module provides declarative management of link aggregation groups on network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of link aggregation definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

= members
        List of members interfaces of the link aggregation group. The value can be single interface or list of interfaces.


- min_links
        Minimum members that should be up before bringing up the link aggregation group.
        [Default: (null)]

- mode
        Mode of the link aggregation group. A value of `on' will enable LACP. `active' configures the link to actively information about
        the state of the link, or it can be configured in `passive' mode ie. send link state information only when received them from
        another link.
        (Choices: on, active, passive)[Default: True]

= name
        Name of the link aggregation group.


- purge
        Purge link aggregation groups not defined in the `aggregate' parameter.
        [Default: False]

- state
        State of the link aggregation group.
        (Choices: present, absent, up, down)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * This module is supported on `ansible_network_os' network platforms. See the :ref:`Network Platform Options
        <platform_options>` for details.
