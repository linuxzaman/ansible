        Policy objects form the match criteria for policy rules and many other functions in PAN-OS. These may include address object,
        address groups, service objects, service groups, and tag.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Consolidating code base.
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use U(https://galaxy.ansible.com/PaloAltoNetworks/paloaltonetworks) instead.
