> FLATPAK    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/packaging/os/flatpak.py)

        Allows users to add or remove flatpaks. See the [flatpak_remote] module for managing flatpak remotes.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- executable
        The path to the `flatpak' executable to use.
        By default, this module looks for the `flatpak' executable on the path.
        [Default: flatpak]

- method
        The installation method to use.
        Defines if the `flatpak' is supposed to be installed globally for the whole `system' or only for the current `user'.
        (Choices: system, user)[Default: system]

= name
        The name of the flatpak to manage.
        When used with `state=present', `name' can be specified as an `http(s') URL to a `flatpakref' file or the unique reverse DNS name
        that identifies a flatpak.
        When suppying a reverse DNS name, you can use the `remote' option to specify on what remote to look for the flatpak. An example
        for a reverse DNS name is `org.gnome.gedit'.
        When used with `state=absent', it is recommended to specify the name in the reverse DNS format.
        When supplying an `http(s') URL with `state=absent', the module will try to match the installed flatpak based on the name of the
        flatpakref to remove it. However, there is no guarantee that the names of the flatpakref file and the reverse DNS name of the
        installed flatpak do match.


- remote
        The flatpak remote (repository) to install the flatpak from.
        By default, `flathub' is assumed, but you do need to add the flathub flatpak_remote before you can use this.
        See the [flatpak_remote] module for managing flatpak remotes.
        [Default: flathub]

- state
        Indicates the desired package state.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
