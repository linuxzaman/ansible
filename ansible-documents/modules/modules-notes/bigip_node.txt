        Manages F5 BIG-IP LTM nodes.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        IP address of the node. This can be either IPv4 or IPv6. When creating a new node, one of either `address' or `fqdn' must be
        provided. This parameter cannot be updated after it is set.
        (Aliases: ip, host)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.2
        

- availability_requirements
        Specifies, if you activate more than one health monitor, the number of health monitors that must receive successful responses in
        order for the link to be considered available.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          at_least:
            description:
            - Specifies the minimum number of active health monitors that must be successful
              before the link is considered up.
            - This parameter is only relevant when a `type' of `at_least' is used.
            - This parameter will be ignored if a type of `all' is used.
            type: int
          type:
            choices:
            - all
            - at_least
            description:
            - Monitor rule type when `monitors' is specified.
            - When creating a new pool, if this value is not specified, the default of 'all'
              will be used.
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.8
        

- connection_limit
        Node connection limit. Setting this to 0 disables the limit.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.7
        

- description
        Specifies descriptive text that identifies the node.
        You can remove a description by either specifying an empty string, or by specifying the special value `none'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- dynamic_ratio
        The dynamic ratio number for the node. Used for dynamic ratio load balancing.
        When creating a new node, if this parameter is not specified, the default of `1' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.7
        

- fqdn
        FQDN name of the node. This can be any name that is a valid RFC 1123 DNS name. Therefore, the only characters that can be used
        are "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", the hyphen ("-") and the period (".").
        FQDN names must include at lease one period; delineating the host from the domain. ex. `host.domain'.
        FQDN names must end with a letter or a number.
        When creating a new node, one of either `address' or `fqdn' must be provided. This parameter cannot be updated after it is set.
        (Aliases: hostname)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

- fqdn_address_type
        Specifies whether the FQDN of the node resolves to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
        When creating a new node, if this parameter is not specified and `fqdn' is specified, this parameter will default to `ipv4'.
        This parameter cannot be changed after it has been set.
        (Choices: ipv4, ipv6, all)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

- fqdn_auto_populate
        Specifies whether the system automatically creates ephemeral nodes using the IP addresses returned by the resolution of a DNS
        query for a node defined by an FQDN.
        When `yes', the system generates an ephemeral node for each IP address returned in response to a DNS query for the FQDN of the
        node. Additionally, when a DNS response indicates the IP address of an ephemeral node no longer exists, the system deletes the
        ephemeral node.
        When `no', the system resolves a DNS query for the FQDN of the node with the single IP address associated with the FQDN.
        When creating a new node, if this parameter is not specified and `fqdn' is specified, this parameter will default to `yes'.
        This parameter cannot be changed after it has been set.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.6
        

- fqdn_down_interval
        Specifies the interval in which a query occurs, when the DNS server is down. The associated monitor continues polling as long as
        the DNS server is down.
        When creating a new node, if this parameter is not specified and `fqdn' is specified, this parameter will default to `5'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.6
        

- fqdn_up_interval
        Specifies the interval in which a query occurs, when the DNS server is up. The associated monitor attempts to probe three times,
        and marks the server down if it there is no response within the span of three times the interval value, in seconds.
        This parameter accepts a value of `ttl' to query based off of the TTL of the FQDN. The default TTL interval is akin to specifying
        `3600'.
        When creating a new node, if this parameter is not specified and `fqdn' is specified, this parameter will default to `3600'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

- monitor_type
        Monitor rule type when `monitors' is specified. When creating a new pool, if this value is not specified, the default of
        'and_list' will be used.
        Both `single' and `and_list' are functionally identical since BIG-IP considers all monitors as "a list". BIG=IP either has a list
        of many, or it has a list of one. Where they differ is in the extra guards that `single' provides; namely that it only allows a
        single monitor.
        (Choices: and_list, m_of_n, single)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.3

- monitors
        Specifies the health monitors that the system currently uses to monitor this node.
        [Default: (null)]

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
