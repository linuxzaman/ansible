OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- appflowlog
        Enable logging appflow flow information.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- cip
        In the request that is forwarded to the GSLB service, insert a header that stores the client's IP address. Client IP header
        insertion is used in connection-proxy based site persistence.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- cipheader
        Name for the HTTP header that stores the client's IP address. Used with the Client IP option. If client IP header insertion is
        enabled on the service and a name is not specified for the header, the NetScaler appliance uses the name specified by the
        cipHeader parameter in the set ns param command or, in the GUI, the Client IP Header parameter in the Configure HTTP Parameters
        dialog box.
        Minimum length = 1

        used.
        Minimum value = 0
        Maximum value = 31536000

        Any comments that you might want to associate with the GSLB service.
        [Default: (null)]

- downstateflush
        Flush all active transactions associated with the GSLB service when its state transitions from UP to DOWN. Do not enable this
        option for services that must complete their transactions. Applicable if connection proxy based site persistence is used.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- maxaaausers
        Maximum number of SSL VPN users that can be logged on concurrently to the VPN virtual server that is represented by this GSLB

        [Default: (null)]

- maxclient
        The maximum number of open connections that the service can support at any given time. A GSLB service whose connection count
        reaches the maximum is not considered when a GSLB decision is made, until the connection count drops below the maximum.
        Minimum value = `0'
        Maximum value = `4294967294'
        [Default: (null)]

            - Maximum value = `100'
        

- monthreshold
        Monitoring threshold value for the GSLB service. If the sum of the weights of the monitors that are bound to this GSLB service
        and are in the UP state is not equal to or greater than this threshold value, the service is marked as DOWN.
        Minimum value = `0'

        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- servername
        Name of the server hosting the GSLB service.
        Minimum length = 1
        [Default: (null)]

- servicename
        Name for the GSLB service. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore `_' character, and must contain only ASCII
        alphanumeric, underscore `_', hash `#', period `.', space, colon `:', at `@', equals `=', and hyphen `-' characters. Can be
        changed after the GSLB service is created.

        Minimum length = 1
        [Default: (null)]

- siteprefix
        The site's prefix string. When the service is bound to a GSLB virtual server, a GSLB site domain is generated internally for each
        bound service-domain pair by concatenating the site prefix of the service and the name of the domain. If the special string NONE
        is specified, the site-prefix string is unset. When implementing HTTP redirect site persistence, the NetScaler appliance
        redirects GSLB requests to GSLB services by using their site domains.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        The state of the resource being configured by the module on the netscaler node.
        When present the resource will be created if needed and configured according to the module's parameters.

        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
        certificates.
