> BIGIP_FIREWALL_GLOBAL_RULES    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_firewall_global_rules.py)

        Configures the global network firewall rules. These firewall rules are applied to all packets except those going through the
        management interface. They are applied first, before any firewall rules for the packet's virtual server, route domain, and/or
        self IP.

        overrides the global service policy. For example, when a service policy is configured both at a global level, as well as on a
        firewall rule, and a flow matches the rule, the more specific service policy configuration in the rule will override the service
        policy setting at the global level.
        The service policy associated here can be created using the `bigip_service_policy' module.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
