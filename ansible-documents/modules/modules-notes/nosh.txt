        Control running and enabled state for system-wide or user services. BSD and Linux systems are supported.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- enabled
        Enable or disable the service, independently of `*.preset' file preference or running state. Mutually exclusive with `preset'.
        Will take effect prior to `state=reset'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        Name of the service to manage.


- preset
        Enable or disable the service according to local preferences in *.preset files. Mutually exclusive with `enabled'. Only has an
        effect if set to true. Will take effect prior to `state=reset'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- state
        `started'/`stopped' are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary. `restarted' will always bounce the
        service. `reloaded' will send a SIGHUP or start the service. `reset' will start or stop the service according to whether it is
        enabled or not.
        (Choices: started, stopped, reset, restarted, reloaded)[Default: (null)]

- user
        Run system-control talking to the calling user's service manager, rather than the system-wide service manager.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
