> EC2_VPC_DHCP_OPTION    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/amazon/ec2_vpc_dhcp_option.py)

        This module removes, or creates DHCP option sets, and can associate them to a VPC. Optionally, a new DHCP Options set can be
        created that converges a VPC's existing DHCP option set with values provided. When dhcp_options_id is provided, the module will
        1. remove (with state='absent') 2. ensure tags are applied (if state='present' and tags are provided 3. attach it to a VPC (if
        state='present' and a vpc_id is provided. If any of the optional values are missing, they will either be treated as a no-op
        (i.e., inherit what already exists for the VPC) To remove existing options while inheriting, supply an empty value (e.g. set
        ntp_servers to [] if you want to remove them from the VPC's options) Most of the options should be self-explanatory.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- delete_old
        Whether to delete the old VPC DHCP option set when associating a new one. This is primarily useful for debugging/development
        purposes when you want to quickly roll back to the old option set. Note that this setting will be ignored, and the old DHCP
        option set will be preserved, if it is in use by any other VPC. (Otherwise, AWS will return an error.)
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- dhcp_options_id
        The resource_id of an existing DHCP options set. If this is specified, then it will override other settings, except tags (which
        will be updated to match)
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- dns_servers
        A list of hosts to set the DNS servers for the VPC to. (Should be a list of IP addresses rather than host names.)
        [Default: (null)]

- domain_name
        The domain name to set in the DHCP option sets
        [Default: (null)]

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- inherit_existing
        For any DHCP options not specified in these parameters, whether to inherit them from the options set already applied to vpc_id,
        or to reset them to be empty.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- netbios_name_servers
        List of hosts to advertise as NetBIOS servers.
        [Default: (null)]

- netbios_node_type
        NetBIOS node type to advertise in the DHCP options. The AWS recommendation is to use 2 (when using netbios name services)
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html
        [Default: (null)]

- ntp_servers
        List of hosts to advertise as NTP servers for the VPC.
        [Default: (null)]

- profile
        Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- region
        The AWS region to use. If not specified then the value of the AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION environment variable, if any, is used. See
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region
        (Aliases: aws_region, ec2_region)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- security_token
        AWS STS security token. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable is used.
        (Aliases: access_token)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- state
        create/assign or remove the DHCP options. If state is set to absent, then a DHCP options set matched either by id, or tags and
        options will be removed if possible.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        version_added: 2.1

- tags
        Tags to be applied to a VPC options set if a new one is created, or if the resource_id is provided. (options must match)
        (Aliases: resource_tags)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- validate_certs
        When set to "no", SSL certificates will not be validated for boto versions >= 2.6.0.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.5

- vpc_id
        VPC ID to associate with the requested DHCP option set. If no vpc id is provided, and no matching option set is found then a new
        DHCP option set is created.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  boto, python >= 2.6
