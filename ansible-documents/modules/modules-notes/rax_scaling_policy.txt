NOTES:
      * The following environment variables can be used, `RAX_USERNAME', `RAX_API_KEY', `RAX_CREDS_FILE', `RAX_CREDENTIALS',
        `RAX_REGION'.
      * `RAX_CREDENTIALS' and `RAX_CREDS_FILE' points to a credentials file appropriate for pyrax. See
        https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#authenticating
      * `RAX_USERNAME' and `RAX_API_KEY' obviate the use of a credentials file
      * `RAX_REGION' defines a Rackspace Public Cloud region (DFW, ORD, LON, ...)
