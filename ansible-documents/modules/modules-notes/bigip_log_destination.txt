        Manages log destinations on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        Specifies the IP address that will receive messages from the specified local Log Destination.
        This parameter is only available when `type' is `management-port'.
        When creating a new log destination and `type' is `management-port', this parameter is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8
        

- description
        The description of the log destination.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- distribution
        Specifies the distribution method used by the Remote High Speed Log destination to send messages to pool members.
        When `adaptive', connections to pool members will be added as required to provide enough logging bandwidth. This can have the
        undesirable effect of logs accumulating on only one pool member when it provides sufficient logging bandwidth on its own.
        When `balanced', sends each successive log to a new pool member, balancing the logs among them according to the pool's load
        balancing method.
        When `replicated', replicates each log to all pool members, for redundancy.
        When creating a new log destination and `type' is `remote-high-speed-log', if this parameter is not specified, the default is
        `adaptive'.
        (Choices: adaptive, balanced, replicated)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8
        

- forward_to
        When `type' is `remote-syslog', specifies the management port log destination, which will be used to forward the logs to a single
        log server, or a remote high-speed log destination, which will be used to forward the logs to a pool of remote log servers.
        When `type' is `splunk' or `arcsight', specifies the log destination to which logs are forwarded. This log destination may be a
        management port destination, a remote high-speed log destination, or a remote Syslog destination which is configured to send logs
        to an ArcSight or Splunk server.
        When creating a new log destination and `type' is `remote-syslog', `splunk', or `arcsight', this parameter is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8
        

= name
        Specifies the name of the log destination.

        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- pool
        When `type' is `remote-high-speed-log', specifies the existing pool of remote high-speed log servers where logs will be sent.
        When `type' is `ipfix', specifies the existing LTM pool of remote IPFIX collectors. Any BIG-IP application that uses this log
        destination sends its IP-traffic logs to this pool of collectors.
        When creating a new destination and `type' is `remote-high-speed-log' or `ipfix', this parameter is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8
        

- pool_settings

        Deprecated. Use the equivalent top-level parameters instead.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
