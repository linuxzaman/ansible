> FORTIOS_SWITCH_CONTROLLER_MANAGED_SWITCH    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_switch_controller_managed_switch.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify switch_controller feature and
        managed_switch category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with
        FOS v6.0.2
