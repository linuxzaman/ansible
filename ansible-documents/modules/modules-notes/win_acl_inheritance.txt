> WIN_ACL_INHERITANCE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_acl_inheritance.py)

        Change ACL (Access Control List) inheritance and optionally copy inherited ACE's (Access Control Entry) to dedicated ACE's or
        vice versa.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= path
        Path to be used for changing inheritance

        type: path

- reorganize
        For P(state) = `absent', indicates if the inherited ACE's should be copied from the parent directory. This is necessary (in
        combination with removal) for a simple ACL instead of using multiple ACE deny entries.
        For P(state) = `present', indicates if the inherited ACE's should be deduplicated compared to the parent directory. This removes
        complexity of the ACL structure.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- state
        Specify whether to enable `present' or disable `absent' ACL inheritance.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: absent]
        type: str
