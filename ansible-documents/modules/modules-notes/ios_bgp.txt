- operation
        Specifies the operation to be performed on the BGP process configured on the device.
        In case of merge, the input configuration will be merged with the existing BGP configuration on the device.
        In case of replace, if there is a diff between the existing configuration and the input configuration, the existing configuration
        will be replaced by the input configuration for every option that has the diff.
        In case of override, all the existing BGP configuration will be removed from the device and replaced with the input
        configuration.
        In case of delete the existing BGP configuration will be removed from the device.
