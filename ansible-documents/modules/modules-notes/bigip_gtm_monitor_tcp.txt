OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- ignore_down_response
        Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
        When `yes', specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout
        is reached without the system receiving an up response, the system marks the object down.
        When `no', specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it receives a down response.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- interval
        The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this template will run.
        If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 30.
        This value *must* be less than the `timeout' value.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value
        will be '*'.
        If this value is an IP address, then a `port' number must be specified.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        Monitor name.

        type: str

- parent
        The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the
        `tcp' parent on the `Common' partition.
        [Default: /Common/tcp]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- port
        Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- probe_timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request to the system.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `5'.

            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This argument is only used for `cli' transports.

            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.

            - The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative
              privileges on the device.

- receive
        The receive string for the monitor call.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- reverse
        Instructs the system to mark the target resource down when the test is successful. This setting is useful, for example, if the
        content on your web site home page is dynamic and changes frequently, you may want to set up a reverse ECV service check that
        looks for the string Error.
        A match for this string means that the web server was down.
        To use this option, you must specify values for `send' and `receive'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- send
        The send string for the monitor call.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- state
        When `present', ensures that the monitor exists.
        When `absent', ensures the monitor is removed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
        type: str

- timeout
        The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to the monitor request. If the target responds within the set
        time period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down. You can
        change this number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the interval number of seconds plus 1 second.
        If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 120.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- transparent
        Specifies whether the monitor operates in transparent mode.
        A monitor in transparent mode directs traffic through the associated pool members or nodes (usually a router or firewall) to the
        aliased destination (that is, it probes the `ip'-`port' combination specified in the monitor).
        If the monitor cannot successfully reach the aliased destination, the pool member or node through which the monitor traffic was
        sent is marked down.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
