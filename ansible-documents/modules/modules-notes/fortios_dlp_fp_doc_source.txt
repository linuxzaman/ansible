> FORTIOS_DLP_FP_DOC_SOURCE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_dlp_fp_doc_source.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to configure dlp feature and fp_doc_source category.
        Examples includes all options and need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2
