        Management of LXD profiles

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- client_cert
        The client certificate file path.
        (Aliases: cert_file)[Default: "{}/.config/lxc/client.crt" .format(os.environ["HOME"])]

- client_key
        The client certificate key file path.
        (Aliases: key_file)[Default: "{}/.config/lxc/client.key" .format(os.environ["HOME"])]

- config
        The config for the container (e.g. {"limits.memory": "4GB"}). See https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/rest-api.md#patch-3
        If the profile already exists and its "config" value in metadata obtained from GET /1.0/profiles/<name>
        https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/rest-api.md#get-19 are different, they this module tries to apply the configurations.
        Not all config values are supported to apply the existing profile. Maybe you need to delete and recreate a profile.
        [Default: (null)]

- description
        Description of the profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.5

- devices
        The devices for the profile (e.g. {"rootfs": {"path": "/dev/kvm", "type": "unix-char"}). See
        https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/rest-api.md#patch-3
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of a profile.


- new_name
        A new name of a profile.
        If this parameter is specified a profile will be renamed to this name. See https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/rest-
        api.md#post-11
        [Default: (null)]

- snap_url
        The unix domain socket path when LXD is installed by snap package manager.
        [Default: unix:/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/unix.socket]
        version_added: 2.8

- state
        Define the state of a profile.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- trust_password
        The client trusted password.
        You need to set this password on the LXD server before running this module using the following command. lxc config set
        core.trust_password <some random password> See https://www.stgraber.org/2016/04/18/lxd-api-direct-interaction/
        If trust_password is set, this module send a request for authentication before sending any requests.
        [Default: (null)]

- url
        The unix domain socket path or the https URL for the LXD server.
        [Default: unix:/var/lib/lxd/unix.socket]


NOTES:
      * Profiles must have a unique name. If you attempt to create a profile with a name that already existed in the users
        namespace the module will simply return as "unchanged".
