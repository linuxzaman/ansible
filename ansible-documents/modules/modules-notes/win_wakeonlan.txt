> WIN_WAKEONLAN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_wakeonlan.py)

        The `win_wakeonlan' module sends magic Wake-on-LAN (WoL) broadcast packets. For non-Windows targets, use the [wakeonlan] module
        instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- broadcast
        Network broadcast address to use for broadcasting magic Wake-on-LAN packet.
        [Default: 255.255.255.255]
        type: str

= mac
        MAC address to send Wake-on-LAN broadcast packet for.

        type: str

- port
        UDP port to use for magic Wake-on-LAN packet.
        [Default: 7]
        type: int


NOTES:
      * This module sends a magic packet, without knowing whether it worked. It always report a change.
      * Only works if the target system was properly configured for Wake-on-LAN (in the BIOS and/or the OS).
      * Some BIOSes have a different (configurable) Wake-on-LAN boot order (i.e. PXE first).
