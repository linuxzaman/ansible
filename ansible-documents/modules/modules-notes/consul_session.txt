> CONSUL_SESSION    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/clustering/consul_session.py)

        Allows the addition, modification and deletion of sessions in a consul cluster. These sessions can then be used in conjunction
        with key value pairs to implement distributed locks. In depth documentation for working with sessions can be found at
        http://www.consul.io/docs/internals/sessions.html

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- behavior
        The optional behavior that can be attached to the session when it is created. This controls the behavior when a session is
        invalidated.
        (Choices: delete, release)[Default: release]
        version_added: 2.2

- checks
        A list of checks that will be used to verify the session health. If all the checks fail, the session will be invalidated and any
        locks associated with the session will be release and can be acquired once the associated lock delay has expired.
        [Default: (null)]

- datacenter
        The name of the datacenter in which the session exists or should be created.
        [Default: (null)]

- delay
        The optional lock delay that can be attached to the session when it is created. Locks for invalidated sessions ar blocked from
        being acquired until this delay has expired. Durations are in seconds.
        [Default: 15]

- host
        The host of the consul agent defaults to localhost.
        [Default: localhost]

- name
        The name that should be associated with the session. This is opaque to Consul and not required.
        [Default: (null)]

- node
        The name of the node that with which the session will be associated. by default this is the name of the agent.
        [Default: (null)]

- port
        The port on which the consul agent is running.
        [Default: 8500]

- scheme
        The protocol scheme on which the consul agent is running.
        [Default: http]
        version_added: 2.1

- state
        Whether the session should be present i.e. created if it doesn't exist, or absent, removed if present. If created, the ID for the
        session is returned in the output. If absent, the name or ID is required to remove the session. Info for a single session, all
        the sessions for a node or all available sessions can be retrieved by specifying info, node or list for the state; for node or
        info, the node name or session id is required as parameter.
        (Choices: absent, info, list, node, present)[Default: present]

- validate_certs
        Whether to verify the tls certificate of the consul agent.
        [Default: True]
