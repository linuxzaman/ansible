        Create or remove disk groups and disk pools for NetApp E-series storage arrays.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- criteria_drive_count
        The number of disks to use for building the storage pool. The pool will be expanded if this number exceeds the number of disks
        already in place
        [Default: (null)]

- criteria_drive_interface_type
        The interface type to use when selecting drives for the storage pool (no value means all interface types will be considered)
        (Choices: sas, sas4k, fibre, fibre520b, scsi, sata, pata)[Default: (null)]

- criteria_drive_min_size
        The minimum individual drive size (in size_unit) to consider when choosing drives for the storage pool.
        [Default: (null)]

- criteria_drive_require_fde
        Whether full disk encryption ability is required for drives to be added to the storage pool
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- criteria_drive_type
        The type of disk (hdd or ssd) to use when searching for candidates to use.
        (Choices: hdd, ssd)[Default: (null)]

- criteria_min_usable_capacity
        The minimum size of the storage pool (in size_unit). The pool will be expanded if this value exceeds itscurrent size.
        [Default: (null)]

- criteria_size_unit
        The unit used to interpret size parameters
        (Choices: bytes, b, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb, eb, zb, yb)[Default: gb]

- erase_secured_drives
        Whether to erase secured disks before adding to storage pool
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        The name of the storage pool to manage


= raid_level
        Only required when the requested state is 'present'.  The RAID level of the storage pool to be created.
        (Choices: raidAll, raid0, raid1, raid3, raid5, raid6, raidDiskPool)

- remove_volumes
        Prior to removing a storage pool, delete all volumes in the pool.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- reserve_drive_count
        Set the number of drives reserved by the storage pool for reconstruction operations. Only valide on raid disk pools.
        [Default: (null)]

- secure_pool
        Whether to convert to a secure storage pool. Will only work if all drives in the pool are security capable.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

= state
        Whether the specified storage pool should exist or not.
        Note that removing a storage pool currently requires the removal of all defined volumes first.
        (Choices: present, absent)

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
