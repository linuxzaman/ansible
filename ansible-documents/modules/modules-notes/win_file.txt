> WIN_FILE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_file.py)

        Creates (empty) files, updates file modification stamps of existing files, and can create or remove directories. Unlike [file],
        does not modify ownership, permissions or manipulate links. For non-Windows targets, use the [file] module instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= path
        Path to the file being managed.
        (Aliases: dest, name)
        type: path

- state
        If `directory', all immediate subdirectories will be created if they do not exist.
        If `file', the file will NOT be created if it does not exist, see the [copy] or [template] module if you want that behavior.  If
        `absent', directories will be recursively deleted, and files will be removed.
        If `touch', an empty file will be created if the `path' does not exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated
        file access and modification times (similar to the way `touch' works from the command line).
        (Choices: absent, directory, file, touch)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
