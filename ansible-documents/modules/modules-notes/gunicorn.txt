> GUNICORN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/web_infrastructure/gunicorn.py)

        Starts gunicorn with the parameters specified. Common settings for gunicorn configuration are supported. For additional
        configuration use a config file See https://gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html for more options. It's
        recommended to always use the chdir option to avoid problems with the location of the app.
