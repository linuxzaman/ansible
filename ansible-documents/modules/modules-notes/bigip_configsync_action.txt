> BIGIP_CONFIGSYNC_ACTION    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_configsync_action.py)

        Allows one to run different config-sync actions. These actions allow you to manually sync your configuration across multiple BIG-
        IPs when those devices are in an HA pair.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner

= device_group
        The device group that you want to perform config-sync actions on.

        type: str

- overwrite_config
        Indicates that the sync operation overwrites the configuration on the target.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.

NOTES:
      * Requires the objectpath Python package on the host. This is as easy as `pip install objectpath'.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
