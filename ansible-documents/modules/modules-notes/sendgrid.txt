        [Default: (null)]

= subject
        the desired subject for the email


= to_addresses
        a list with one or more recipient email addresses

NOTES:
      * This module is non-idempotent because it sends an email through the external API. It is idempotent only in the case that
        the module fails.
      * Like the other notification modules, this one requires an external dependency to work. In this case, you'll need an active
        SendGrid account.
      * In order to use api_key, cc, bcc, attachments, from_name, html_body, headers you must pip install sendgrid
      * since 2.2 username and password are not required if you supply an api_key
