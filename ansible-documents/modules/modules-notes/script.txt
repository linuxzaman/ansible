> SCRIPT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/commands/script.py)

        The `script' module takes the script name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments. The local script at path will be
        transferred to the remote node and then executed. The given script will be processed through the shell environment on the remote
        node. This module does not require python on the remote system, much like the [raw] module. This module is also supported for
        Windows targets.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- chdir
        Change into this directory on the remote node before running the script.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- creates
        A filename on the remote node, when it already exists, this step will *not* be run.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.5

- decrypt
        This option controls the autodecryption of source files using vault.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- executable
        Name or path of a executable to invoke the script with.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.6

= free_form
        Path to the local script file followed by optional arguments.
        There is no parameter actually named 'free form', see the examples!


- removes
        A filename on the remote node, when it does not exist, this step will *not* be run.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.5


NOTES:
      * It is usually preferable to write Ansible modules rather than pushing scripts. Convert your script to an Ansible module for
        bonus points!
      * The `ssh' connection plugin will force pseudo-tty allocation via `-tt' when scripts are executed. Pseudo-ttys do not have a
        stderr channel and all stderr is sent to stdout. If you depend on separated stdout and stderr result keys, please switch to
        a copy+command set of tasks instead of using script.
      * If the path to the local script contains spaces, it needs to be quoted.
      * This module is also supported for Windows targets.
