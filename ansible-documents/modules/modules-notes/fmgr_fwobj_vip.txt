OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- adom
        The ADOM the configuration should belong to.
        [Default: root]

- arp_reply
        Enable to respond to ARP requests for this virtual IP address. Enabled by default.
        choice | disable | Disable ARP reply.
        choice | enable | Enable ARP reply.
        (Choices: disable, enable)[Default: (null)]

- color
        Color of icon on the GUI.
        [Default: (null)]

- comment
        Comment.
        [Default: (null)]

- dns_mapping_ttl
        DNS mapping TTL (Set to zero to use TTL in DNS response, default = 0).
        [Default: (null)]

- dynamic_mapping
        EXPERTS ONLY! KNOWLEDGE OF FMGR JSON API IS REQUIRED!
        List of multiple child objects to be added. Expects a list of dictionaries.
        Dictionaries must use FortiManager API parameters, not the ansible ones listed below.
        If submitted, all other prefixed sub-parameters ARE IGNORED.
        This object is MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE with its options.
        We expect that you know what you are doing with these list parameters, and are leveraging the JSON API Guide.
        WHEN IN DOUBT, USE THE SUB OPTIONS BELOW INSTEAD TO CREATE OBJECTS WITH MULTIPLE TASKS
