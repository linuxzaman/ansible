        Manages HSRP configuration on NX-OS switches.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_string
        Authentication string. If this needs to be hidden(for md5 type), the string should be 7 followed by the key string. Otherwise, it
        can be 0 followed by key string or just key string (for backward compatibility). For text type, this should be just be a key
        string. if this is 'default', authentication is removed.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_type
        Authentication type.
        (Choices: text, md5)[Default: (null)]

= group
        HSRP group number.


= interface
        Full name of interface that is being managed for HSRP.


- preempt
        Enable/Disable preempt.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- priority
        HSRP priority or keyword 'default'.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.

            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.

          authorize:
            default: false
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.

            version_added: 2.5.3
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              is a common argument used for either `cli' or `nxapi' transports. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 0 (use common port)
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,
              http=80, https=443).
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              argument is only used for the `cli' transport. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return
              on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).

            description:
            - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.  The

          use_ssl:

            description:
            - Configures the `transport' to use SSL if set to `yes' only when the `transport=nxapi',
              otherwise this value is ignored.
            type: bool
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME' will
              be used instead.

              personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
              argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
            type: bool
        
        type: dict

- state
        Specify desired state of the resource.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- version
        HSRP version.
        (Choices: 1, 2)[Default: 1]

- vip
        HSRP virtual IP address or keyword 'default'
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
      * HSRP feature needs to be enabled first on the system.
      * SVIs must exist before using this module.
      * Interface must be a L3 port before using this module.
      * HSRP cannot be configured on loopback interfaces.
      * MD5 authentication is only possible with HSRPv2 while it is ignored if HSRPv1 is used instead, while it will not raise any
        error. Here we allow MD5 authentication only with HSRPv2 in order to enforce better practice.
