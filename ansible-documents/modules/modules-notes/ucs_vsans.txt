        Configures VSANs on Cisco UCS Manager. Examples can be used with the UCS Platform Emulator https://communities.cisco.com/ucspe.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- fabric
        The fabric configuration of the VSAN.  This can be one of the following:
        common - The VSAN maps to the same VSAN ID in all available fabrics.
        A - The VSAN maps to the a VSAN ID that exists only in fabric A.
        B - The VSAN maps to the a VSAN ID that exists only in fabric B.
        (Choices: common, A, B)[Default: common]

- fc_zoning
        Fibre Channel zoning configuration for the Cisco UCS domain.
        Fibre Channel zoning can be set to one of the following values:
        disabled — The upstream switch handles Fibre Channel zoning, or Fibre Channel zoning is not implemented for the Cisco UCS domain.
        enabled — Cisco UCS Manager configures and controls Fibre Channel zoning for the Cisco UCS domain.
        If you enable Fibre Channel zoning, do not configure the upstream switch with any VSANs that are being used for Fibre Channel
        zoning.
        (Choices: disabled, enabled)[Default: disabled]

= hostname
        IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.

        type: str

= name
        The name assigned to the VSAN.
        This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters.
        You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), "_" (underscore), : (colon), and . (period).
        You cannot change this name after the VSAN is created.


= password
        Password for Cisco UCS Manager authentication.

        type: str

- port
        Port number to be used during connection (by default uses 443 for https and 80 for http connection).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- proxy
        If use_proxy is no, specfies proxy to be used for connection. e.g. 'http://proxy.xy.z:8080'
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        If `present', will verify VSANs are present and will create if needed.
        If `absent', will verify VSANs are absent and will delete if needed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- use_proxy
        If `no', will not use the proxy as defined by system environment variable.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- use_ssl
        If `no', an HTTP connection will be used instead of the default HTTPS connection.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- username
        Username for Cisco UCS Manager authentication.
        [Default: admin]
        type: str

= vlan_id
        The unique string identifier assigned to the VLAN used for Fibre Channel connections.
        Note that Cisco UCS Manager uses VLAN '4048'.  See the UCS Manager configuration guide if you want to assign '4048' to a VLAN.
        Optional if state is absent.


= vsan_id
        The unique identifier assigned to the VSAN.
        The ID can be a string between '1' and '4078', or between '4080' and '4093'. '4079' is a reserved VSAN ID.
        In addition, if you plan to use FC end-host mode, the range between '3840' to '4079' is also a reserved VSAN ID range.
        Optional if state is absent.
