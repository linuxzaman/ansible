> EOS_COMMAND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/eos/eos_command.py)

        Sends an arbitrary set of commands to an EOS node and returns the results read from the device.  This module includes an argument
        that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= commands
        The commands to send to the remote EOS device over the configured provider.  The resulting output from the command is returned.
        If the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of `retries'
        has been exceeded.


- interval
        Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command.  If the command does not pass the specified
        conditional, the interval indicates how to long to wait before trying the command again.
        [Default: 1]

- match
        The `match' argument is used in conjunction with the `wait_for' argument to specify the match policy.  Valid values are `all' or
        `any'.  If the value is set to `all' then all conditionals in the `wait_for' must be satisfied.  If the value is set to `any'
        then only one of the values must be satisfied.
        (Choices: any, all)[Default: all]
        version_added: 2.2

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for

            - Configures the `transport' to use SSL if set to `yes' only when the `transport=eapi'.  If

              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified

        type: dict

- retries
        Specifies the number of retries a command should be tried before it is considered failed.  The command is run on the target
        device every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for' conditionals.
        [Default: 10]

- wait_for
        Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command and what conditionals to apply.  This argument will cause the task to
        wait for a particular conditional to be true before moving forward.   If the conditional is not true by the configured retries,
        the task fails. Note - With `wait_for' the value in `result['stdout']' can be accessed using `result', that is to access
        `result['stdout'][0]' use `result[0]' See examples.
