        Add or remove a host to Icinga2 through the API. See https://www.icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- check_command
        The command used to check if the host is alive.
        [Default: hostalive]

- client_cert
        PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client authentication. This file can also include the key as well, and if
        the key is included, `client_key' is not required.
        [Default: (null)]

- client_key
        PEM formatted file that contains your private key to be used for SSL client authentication. If `client_cert' contains both the
        certificate and key, this option is not required.
        [Default: (null)]

- display_name
        The name used to display the host.
        [Default: if none is give it is the value of the <name> parameter]

- force_basic_auth
        httplib2, the library used by the uri module only sends authentication information when a webservice responds to an initial
        request with a 401 status. Since some basic auth services do not properly send a 401, logins will fail. This option forces the
        sending of the Basic authentication header upon initial request.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

= ip
        The IP address of the host.


= name
        Name used to create / delete the host. This does not need to be the FQDN, but does needs to be unique.


- state
        Apply feature state.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- template
        The template used to define the host.
        Template cannot be modified after object creation.
        [Default: (null)]

= url
        HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path


- url_password
        The password for use in HTTP basic authentication.
        If the `url_username' parameter is not specified, the `url_password' parameter will not be used.
        [Default: (null)]

- url_username
        The username for use in HTTP basic authentication.
        This parameter can be used without `url_password' for sites that allow empty passwords.
        [Default: (null)]

- use_proxy
        If `no', it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an environment variable on the target hosts.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
        certificates.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- variables
        List of variables.
