> VMWARE_DVSWITCH_PVLANS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/vmware/vmware_dvswitch_pvlans.py)

        This module can be used to configure Private VLANs (PVLANs) on a Distributed Switch.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_HOST' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- password
        The password of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PASSWORD' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- port
        The port number of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PORT' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.5

- primary_pvlans
        A list of VLAN IDs that should be configured as Primary PVLANs.
        If `primary_pvlans' isn't specified, all PVLANs will be deleted if present.
        Each member of the list requires primary_pvlan_id (int) set.
        The secondary promiscuous PVLAN will be created automatically.
        If `secondary_pvlans' isn't specified, the primary PVLANs and each secondary promiscuous PVLAN will be created.
        Please see examples for more information.
        [Default: []]
        type: list

- secondary_pvlans
        A list of VLAN IDs that should be configured as Secondary PVLANs.
        `primary_pvlans' need to be specified to create any Secodary PVLAN.
        If `primary_pvlans' isn't specified, all PVLANs will be deleted if present.
        Each member of the list requires primary_pvlan_id (int), secondary_pvlan_id (int), and pvlan_type (str) to be set.
        The type of the secondary PVLAN can be isolated or community. The secondary promiscuous PVLAN will be created automatically.
        Please see examples for more information.
        [Default: []]
        type: list

= switch
        The name of the Distributed Switch.
        (Aliases: dvswitch)
        type: str

- username
        The username of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_USER' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: admin, user)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- validate_certs
        Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to `false' when certificates are not trusted.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_VALIDATE_CERTS' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        If set to `yes', please make sure Python >= 2.7.9 is installed on the given machine.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
