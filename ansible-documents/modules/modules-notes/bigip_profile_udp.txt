> BIGIP_PROFILE_UDP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_profile_udp.py)

        Manage UDP profiles on a BIG-IP. Many of UDP profiles exist; each with their own adjustments to the standard `udp' profile. Users
        of this module should be aware that many of the adjustable knobs have no module default. Instead, the default is assigned by the
        BIG-IP system itself which, in most cases, is acceptable.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- datagram_load_balancing
        Specifies, when `yes', that the system load balances UDP traffic packet-by-packet.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- idle_timeout
        Specifies the length of time that a connection is idle (has no traffic) before the connection is eligible for deletion.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the remote device will choose a default value appropriate for
        the profile, based on its `parent' profile.
        When a number is specified, indicates the number of seconds that the UDP connection can remain idle before the system deletes it.
        When `0', or `indefinite', specifies that UDP connections can remain idle indefinitely.
        When `immediate', specifies that you do not want the UDP connection to remain idle, and that it is therefore immediately eligible
        for deletion.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        Specifies the name of the profile.

        type: str

- parent
        Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied `udp' profile.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
