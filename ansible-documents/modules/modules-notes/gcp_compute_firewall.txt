        Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the instances. All traffic to instances, even from other
        instances, is blocked by the firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it. The default network has automatically
        created firewall rules that are shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has automatically created firewall
        rules except for a default "allow" rule for outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all networks except
        the default network, you must create any firewall rules you need.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- allowed
        The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a
        permitted connection.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          ip_protocol:
            description:
            - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when
              creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well
              known protocol strings (tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, sctp), or the IP protocol number.
            required: true
          ports:
            description:
            - An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable
              for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If
              not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port.
            - 'Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and ["12345-12349"].'
            required: false
        

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- denied
        The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied
        connection.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          ip_protocol:
            description:
            - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when

            required: false
        
        version_added: 2.8
        

- description
        An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
        [Default: (null)]

- destination_ranges
        If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges.
        These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8
        

- direction
        Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to
        specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags.
        (Choices: INGRESS, EGRESS)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8
        

- disabled
        Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the
        firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be
        enabled.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8
        

= name
        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
        means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
        except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- network
        URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:
        global/networks/default If you choose to specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For
        example, the following are all valid URLs: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/ networks/my-network
        projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network global/networks/default .
        This field represents a link to a Network resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_network task and then set this network field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
        [Default: {u'selfLink': u'global/networks/default'}]

- priority
        Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000.
        Relative priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with
        priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
        [Default: 1000]
        version_added: 2.8
        

- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- source_ranges
        If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges
        must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall
        will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the
        sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is supported.
        [Default: (null)]

- source_service_accounts
        If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service
        account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address because
        service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as
        sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
        source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
        properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8
        

- source_tags
        If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags.
        Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address. Because tags are associated with an instance,
        not an IP address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to
        traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property.
        The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- target_service_accounts
        A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in
        allowed[].
        targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor
        targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8
        

- target_tags
        A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in
        allowed[].
        If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.
        [Default: (null)]
