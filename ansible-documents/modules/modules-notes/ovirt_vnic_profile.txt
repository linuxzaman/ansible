- fetch_nested
        If `True' the module will fetch additional data from the API.
        It will fetch IDs of the VMs disks, snapshots, etc. User can configure to fetch other attributes of the nested entities by

        version_added: 2.3

= network
        Name of network to which is vNIC attached.


- network_filter
        The network filter enables to filter packets send to/from the VM's nic according to defined rules.
        [Default: (null)]

- pass_through
        Enables passthrough to an SR-IOV-enabled host NIC.
        When enabled `qos' and  `network_filter' are automatically set to None and `port_mirroring' to False.
        (Choices: disabled, enabled)[Default: (null)]

- poll_interval

        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- qos
        Quality of Service attributes regulate inbound and outbound network traffic of the NIC.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Should the vNIC be absent/present.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]

- timeout

        [Default: 180]
        type: int

- wait
        `yes' if the module should wait for the entity to get into desired state.
        [Default: True]
