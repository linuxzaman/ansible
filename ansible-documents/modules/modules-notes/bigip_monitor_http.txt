- receive
        The receive string for the monitor call.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- receive_disable
        This setting works like `receive', except that the system marks the node or pool member disabled when its response matches the
        `receive_disable' string but not `receive'. To use this setting, you must specify both `receive_disable' and `receive'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- reverse
        Specifies whether the monitor operates in reverse mode.
        When the monitor is in reverse mode, a successful receive string match marks the monitored object down instead of up. You can use
        the this mode only if you configure the `receive' option.
        This parameter is not compatible with the `time_until_up' parameter. If `time_until_up' is specified, it must be `0'. Or, if it
        already exists, it must be `0'.

        used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- state
        When `present', ensures that the monitor exists.
        When `absent', ensures the monitor is removed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

- target_password
        Specifies the password, if the monitored target requires authentication.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- target_username
        Specifies the user name, if the monitored target requires authentication.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- time_until_up
        Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful response before a node will be marked up. A value of 0 will
        cause a node to be marked up immediately after a valid response is received from the node. If this parameter is not provided when
        creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- timeout
        The number of seconds in which the node or service must respond to the monitor request. If the target responds within the set
        time period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down. You can
        change this number to any number you want, however, it should be 3 times the interval number of seconds plus 1 second. If this
        parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 16.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
