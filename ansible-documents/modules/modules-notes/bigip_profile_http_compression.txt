        Manage HTTP compression profiles on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- buffer_size
        Maximum number of compressed bytes that the system buffers before inserting a Content-Length header (which specifies the
        compressed size) into the response.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- description
        Description of the HTTP compression profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- gzip_level
        Specifies the degree to which the system compresses the content.
        Higher compression levels cause the compression process to be slower.
        Valid values are between 1 (least compression and fastest) to 9 (most compression and slowest).
        (Choices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)[Default: (null)]
        type: int

- gzip_memory_level
        Number of kilobytes of memory that the system uses for internal compression buffers when compressing a server response.
        (Choices: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256)[Default: (null)]
        type: int

- gzip_window_size
        Number of kilobytes in the window size that the system uses when compressing a server response.
        (Choices: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128)[Default: (null)]
        type: int

= name
        Specifies the name of the compression profile.

        type: str

- parent
        Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied `httpcompression' profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
