> GCP_COMPUTE_ADDRESS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gcp_compute_address.py)

        Represents an Address resource. Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and, optionally, an external
        IP address. To communicate between instances on the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To communicate
        with the Internet and instances outside of the same network, you must specify the instance's external IP address. Internal IP
        addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and
        recreated, the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be
        either ephemeral or static.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        The static external IP address represented by this resource. Only IPv4 is supported. An address may only be specified for
        INTERNAL address types. The IP address must be inside the specified subnetwork, if any.
        [Default: (null)]

- address_type
        The type of address to reserve, either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL.
        If unspecified, defaults to EXTERNAL.
        (Choices: INTERNAL, EXTERNAL)[Default: EXTERNAL]
        version_added: 2.7
        

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- description
        An optional description of this resource.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
        characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase
        letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
        dash.


- network_tier
        The networking tier used for configuring this address. This field can take the following values: PREMIUM or STANDARD. If this
        field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
        (Choices: PREMIUM, STANDARD)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8
        

- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= region
        URL of the region where the regional address resides.
        This field is not applicable to global addresses.


- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subnetwork
        The URL of the subnetwork in which to reserve the address. If an IP address is specified, it must be within the subnetwork's IP
        range.
        This field can only be used with INTERNAL type with GCE_ENDPOINT/DNS_RESOLVER purposes.
        This field represents a link to a Subnetwork resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_subnetwork task and then set this subnetwork field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7
