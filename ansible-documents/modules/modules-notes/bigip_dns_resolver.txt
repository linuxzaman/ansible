        Manage DNS resolver on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- answer_default_zones
        Specifies whether the system answers DNS queries for the default zones localhost, reverse 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and AS112.
        When creating a new resolver, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `no', meaning that the system passes along the
        DNS queries for the default zones.

        Specifies the size of the internal DNS resolver cache.
        When creating a new resolver, if this parameter is not specified, the default is 5767168 bytes.
        After the cache reaches this size, when new or refreshed content arrives, the system removes expired and older content and caches
        the new or updated content.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
