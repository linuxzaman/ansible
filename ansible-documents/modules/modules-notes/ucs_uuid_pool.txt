> UCS_UUID_POOL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/remote_management/ucs/ucs_uuid_pool.py)

        Configures server UUID pools and UUID blocks on Cisco UCS Manager. Examples can be used with the L(UCS Platform
        Emulator,https://communities.cisco.com/ucspe).

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- description
        The user-defined description of the UUID pool.

        ` (accent mark),  (backslash), ^ (carat), " (double quote), = (equal sign), > (greater than), < (less than), or ' (single quote).
        (Aliases: descr)[Default: (null)]

- first_uuid
        The first UUID in the block of UUIDs.
        This is the From field in the UCS Manager UUID Blocks menu.
        [Default: (null)]

= hostname
        IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.

        type: str

- last_uuid
        The last UUID in the block of UUIDs.
        This is the To field in the UCS Manager Add UUID Blocks menu.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        The name of the UUID pool.
        This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters.
        You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), "_" (underscore), : (colon), and . (period).
        You cannot change this name after the UUID pool is created.


- order
        The Assignment Order field.
        This can be one of the following:
        default - Cisco UCS Manager selects a random identity from the pool.
        sequential - Cisco UCS Manager selects the lowest available identity from the pool.
        (Choices: default, sequential)[Default: default]

- org_dn
        The distinguished name (dn) of the organization where the resource is assigned.
        [Default: org-root]

= password
        Password for Cisco UCS Manager authentication.

        type: str

- port
        Port number to be used during connection (by default uses 443 for https and 80 for http connection).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- prefix
        UUID prefix used for the range of server UUIDs.
        If no value is provided, the system derived prefix will be used (equivalent to selecting 'derived' option in UI).
        If the user provides a value, the user provided prefix will be used (equivalent to selecting 'other' option in UI).
        A user provided value should be in the format XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX.
        [Default: (null)]

- proxy
        If use_proxy is no, specfies proxy to be used for connection. e.g. 'http://proxy.xy.z:8080'
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        If `present', will verify UUID pool is present and will create if needed.
        If `absent', will verify UUID pool is absent and will delete if needed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- use_proxy
        If `no', will not use the proxy as defined by system environment variable.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- use_ssl
        If `no', an HTTP connection will be used instead of the default HTTPS connection.
