> FORTIOS_VPN_IPSEC_PHASE1_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_vpn_ipsec_phase1_interface.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify vpn_ipsec feature and
        phase1_interface category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested
        with FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= host
        FortiOS or FortiGate ip address.
