DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Updated modules released with increased functionality
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.11
	Alternatives: Use M(na_ontap_svm) instead.


  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the ONTAP instance.


= name
        The name of the SVM to manage.


= password
        Password for the specified user.
        (Aliases: pass)

- root_volume
        Root volume of the SVM. Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- root_volume_aggregate
        The aggregate on which the root volume will be created.
        Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- root_volume_security_style
        Security Style of the root volume.
        When specified as part of the vserver-create, this field represents the security style for the Vserver root volume.
        When specified as part of vserver-get-iter call, this will return the list of matching Vservers.
        Possible values are 'unix', 'ntfs', 'mixed'.
        The 'unified' security style, which applies only to Infinite Volumes, cannot be applied to a Vserver's root volume.
        Valid options are "unix" for NFS, "ntfs" for CIFS, "mixed" for Mixed, "unified" for Unified.
        Required when `state=present'
        (Choices: unix, ntfs, mixed, unified)[Default: (null)]

= state
        Whether the specified SVM should exist or not.
        (Choices: present, absent)

= username
        This can be a Cluster-scoped or SVM-scoped account, depending on whether a Cluster-level or SVM-level API is required. For more

NOTES:
      * The modules prefixed with na\\_cdot are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.


REQUIREMENTS:  A physical or virtual clustered Data ONTAP system. The modules were developed with Clustered Data ONTAP 8.3, Ansible
        2.2, netapp-lib (2015.9.25). Install using 'pip install netapp-lib'
