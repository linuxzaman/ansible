> FORTIOS_WEB_PROXY_GLOBAL    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_web_proxy_global.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify web_proxy feature and global
        category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2
