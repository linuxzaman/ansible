> SLXOS_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/slxos/slxos_interface.py)

        This module provides declarative management of Interfaces on Extreme SLX-OS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of Interfaces definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- delay
        Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. This wait is applicable for operational state
        argument which are `state' with values `up'/`down', `tx_rate' and `rx_rate'.
        [Default: 10]

- description
        Description of Interface.
        [Default: (null)]

- enabled
        Interface link status.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- mtu
        Maximum size of transmit packet.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the Interface.


- neighbors
        Check the operational state of given interface `name' for LLDP neighbor.
        The following suboptions are available.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - LLDP neighbor host for given interface `name'.
          port:
            description:
            - LLDP neighbor port to which given interface `name' is connected.
        

- rx_rate
        Receiver rate in bits per second (bps).
        [Default: (null)]

- speed
        Interface link speed.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the Interface configuration, `up' means present and operationally up and `down' means present and operationally `down'
        (Choices: present, absent, up, down)[Default: present]

- tx_rate
        Transmit rate in bits per second (bps).
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Tested against SLX-OS 17s.1.02
