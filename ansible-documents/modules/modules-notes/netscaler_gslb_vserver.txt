        Configure gslb vserver entities in Netscaler.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- appflowlog
        Enable logging appflow flow information.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- backuplbmethod
        Backup load balancing method. Becomes operational if the primary load balancing method fails or cannot be used. Valid only if the
        primary method is based on either round-trip time (RTT) or static proximity.
        (Choices: ROUNDROBIN, LEASTCONNECTION, LEASTRESPONSETIME, SOURCEIPHASH, LEASTBANDWIDTH, LEASTPACKETS, STATICPROXIMITY, RTT,
        CUSTOMLOAD)[Default: (null)]

- comment
        Any comments that you might want to associate with the GSLB virtual server.
        [Default: (null)]

- considereffectivestate
        If the primary state of all bound GSLB services is DOWN, consider the effective states of all the GSLB services, obtained through
        the Metrics Exchange Protocol (MEP), when determining the state of the GSLB virtual server. To consider the effective state, set
        the parameter to STATE_ONLY. To disregard the effective state, set the parameter to NONE.
        The effective state of a GSLB service is the ability of the corresponding virtual server to serve traffic. The effective state of
        the load balancing virtual server, which is transferred to the GSLB service, is UP even if only one virtual server in the backup
        chain of virtual servers is in the UP state.
        (Choices: NONE, STATE_ONLY)[Default: (null)]

- disabled
        When set to `yes' the GSLB Vserver state will be set to `disabled'.
        When set to `no' the GSLB Vserver state will be set to `enabled'.
        Note that due to limitations of the underlying NITRO API a `disabled' state change alone does not cause the module result to
        report a changed status.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- disableprimaryondown
        Continue to direct traffic to the backup chain even after the primary GSLB virtual server returns to the UP state. Used when
        spillover is configured for the virtual server.

        (Choices: DROP, ACCEPT, REDIRECT)[Default: (null)]

- somethod
        Type of threshold that, when exceeded, triggers spillover. Available settings function as follows:
        * `CONNECTION' - Spillover occurs when the number of client connections exceeds the threshold.
        * `DYNAMICCONNECTION' - Spillover occurs when the number of client connections at the GSLB virtual server exceeds the sum of the
        maximum client (Max Clients) settings for bound GSLB services. Do not specify a spillover threshold for this setting, because the
        threshold is implied by the Max Clients settings of the bound GSLB services.
        * `BANDWIDTH' - Spillover occurs when the bandwidth consumed by the GSLB virtual server's incoming and outgoing traffic exceeds
        the threshold.
        * `HEALTH' - Spillover occurs when the percentage of weights of the GSLB services that are UP drops below the threshold. For
        example, if services gslbSvc1, gslbSvc2, and gslbSvc3 are bound to a virtual server, with weights 1, 2, and 3, and the spillover
        threshold is 50%, spillover occurs if gslbSvc1 and gslbSvc3 or gslbSvc2 and gslbSvc3 transition to DOWN.
        * `NONE' - Spillover does not occur.
        (Choices: CONNECTION, DYNAMICCONNECTION, BANDWIDTH, HEALTH, NONE)[Default: (null)]

- sopersistence
        If spillover occurs, maintain source IP address based persistence for both primary and backup GSLB virtual servers.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

        Threshold at which spillover occurs. Specify an integer for the CONNECTION spillover method, a bandwidth value in kilobits per
        second for the BANDWIDTH method (do not enter the units), or a percentage for the HEALTH method (do not enter the percentage
        symbol).
        Minimum value = `1'
        Maximum value = `4294967287'
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        The state of the resource being configured by the module on the netscaler node.

        Maximum value = `1440'
        [Default: (null)]

- tolerance
        Site selection tolerance, in milliseconds, for implementing the RTT load balancing method. If a site's RTT deviates from the
        lowest RTT by more than the specified tolerance, the site is not considered when the NetScaler appliance makes a GSLB decision.
        The appliance implements the round robin method of global server load balancing between sites whose RTT values are within the
        specified tolerance. If the tolerance is 0 (zero), the appliance always sends clients the IP address of the site with the lowest
        RTT.
        Minimum value = `0'
        Maximum value = `100'
        [Default: (null)]

        balancing method.
        Default value: `128'
        Minimum value = `1'
        Maximum value = `128'
        [Default: (null)]

- v6persistmasklen
        Number of bits to consider in an IPv6 source IP address when creating source IP address based persistence sessions.
        Default value: `128'
        Minimum value = `1'
        Maximum value = `128'
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
        certificates.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
