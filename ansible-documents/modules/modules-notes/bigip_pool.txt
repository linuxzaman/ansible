        Manages F5 BIG-IP LTM pools via iControl REST API.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of pool definitions to be created, modified or removed.
        (Aliases: pools)[Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.8
        

- description
        Specifies descriptive text that identifies the pool.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3
        

- lb_method
        Load balancing method. When creating a new pool, if this value is not specified, the default of `round-robin' will be used.
        (Choices: dynamic-ratio-member, dynamic-ratio-node, fastest-app-response, fastest-node, least-connections-member, least-
        connections-node, least-sessions, observed-member, observed-node, predictive-member, predictive-node, ratio-least-connections-
        member, ratio-least-connections-node, ratio-member, ratio-node, ratio-session, round-robin, weighted-least-connections-member,
        weighted-least-connections-node)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.3
        

- metadata
        Arbitrary key/value pairs that you can attach to a pool. This is useful in situations where you might want to annotate a pool to
        me managed by Ansible.
        Key names will be stored as strings; this includes names that are numbers.
        Values for all of the keys will be stored as strings; this includes values that are numbers.
        Data will be persisted, not ephemeral.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: raw
        version_added: 2.5
        

- monitor_type
        Monitor rule type when `monitors' is specified.
        When creating a new pool, if this value is not specified, the default of 'and_list' will be used.
        When `single' ensures that all specified monitors are checked, but additionally includes checks to make sure you only specified a
        single monitor.
        When `and_list' ensures that *all* monitors are checked.
        When `m_of_n' ensures that `quorum' of `monitors' are checked. `m_of_n' *requires* that a `quorum' of 1 or greater be set either
        in the playbook, or already existing on the device.
        Both `single' and `and_list' are functionally identical since BIG-IP considers all monitors as "a list".
        (Choices: and_list, m_of_n, single)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.3
        

- monitors
        Monitor template name list. If the partition is not provided as part of the monitor name, then the `partition' option will be
        used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 1.3
        

= name
        Pool name
        (Aliases: pool)
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5
        

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- priority_group_activation
        Specifies whether the system load balances traffic according to the priority number assigned to the pool member.
        When creating a new pool, if this parameter is not specified, the default of `0' will be used.
        To disable this setting, provide the value `0'.
        Once you enable this setting, you can specify pool member priority when you create a new pool or on a pool member's properties
        screen.
        The system treats same-priority pool members as a group.
        To enable priority group activation, provide a number from `0' to `65535' that represents the minimum number of members that must
        be available in one priority group before the system directs traffic to members in a lower priority group.
        When a sufficient number of members become available in the higher priority group, the system again directs traffic to the higher
        priority group.
        (Aliases: minimum_active_members)[Default: (null)]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.6

NOTES:
      * To add members to a pool, use the `bigip_pool_member' module. Previously, the `bigip_pool' module allowed the management of
        members, but this has been removed in version 2.5 of Ansible.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
