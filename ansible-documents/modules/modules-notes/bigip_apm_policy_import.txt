NOTES:
      * Due to ID685681 it is not possible to execute ng_* tools via REST api on v12.x and 13.x, once this is fixed this
        restriction will be removed.
      * Requires BIG-IP >= 14.0.0
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
