> COBBLER_SYNC    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/remote_management/cobbler/cobbler_sync.py)

        Sync Cobbler to commit changes.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- host
        The name or IP address of the Cobbler system.
        [Default: 127.0.0.1]

= password
        The password to log in to Cobbler.


- port
        Port number to be used for REST connection.
        The default value depends on parameter `use_ssl'.
        [Default: (null)]

- use_ssl
        If `no', an HTTP connection will be used instead of the default HTTPS connection.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- username
        The username to log in to Cobbler.
        [Default: cobbler]

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated.
        This should only set to `no' when used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Concurrently syncing Cobbler is bound to fail with weird errors.
      * On python 2.7.8 and older (i.e. on RHEL7) you may need to tweak the python behaviour to disable certificate validation.
