> FORTIOS_WANOPT_PROFILE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_wanopt_profile.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify wanopt feature and profile
        category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= host
        FortiOS or FortiGate ip address.


- https
        Indicates if the requests towards FortiGate must use HTTPS protocol
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- password
        FortiOS or FortiGate password.
        [Default: ]

= username
        FortiOS or FortiGate username.


- vdom
