> FRR_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/frr/frr_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running FRR.  This module prepends all of the base network fact
        keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or
        disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument restricts the facts collected to a given subset.
        Possible values for this argument include `all', `hardware', `config', and `interfaces'.
        Specify a list of values to include a larger subset.
        Use a value with an initial `!' to collect all facts except that subset.
        [Default: !config]


NOTES:
      * Tested against FRR 6.0.
