        Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM FirePass monitors.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- cipher_list
        Specifies the list of ciphers for this monitor.
        The items in the cipher list are separated with the colon `:' symbol.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default list is `HIGH:!ADH'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- concurrency_limit
        Specifies the maximum percentage of licensed connections currently in use under which the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager
        system up.
        As an example, a setting of 95 percent means that the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system up until 95 percent of
        licensed connections are in use.
        When the number of in-use licensed connections exceeds 95 percent, the monitor marks the Secure Access Manager system down.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `95'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ignore_down_response
        Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
        When `yes', specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout
        is reached without the system receiving an up response, the system marks the object down.
        When `no', specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it receives a down response.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- interval
        The interval specifying how frequently the monitor instance of this template will run.
        If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be 30.
        This value *must* be less than the `timeout' value.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value
        will be '*'.
        If this value is an IP address, then a `port' number must be specified.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- max_load_average
        Specifies the number that the monitor uses to mark the Secure Access Manager system up or down.
        The system compares the Max Load Average setting against a one-minute average of the Secure Access Manager system load.
        When the Secure Access Manager system-load average falls within the specified Max Load Average, the monitor marks the Secure
        Access Manager system up.
        When the average exceeds the setting, the monitor marks the system down.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `12'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= name
        Monitor name.

        type: str

- parent
        The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the
        `tcp' parent on the `Common' partition.
        [Default: /Common/firepass_gtm]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- port
        Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- probe_timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request to the system.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `5'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- provider

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
