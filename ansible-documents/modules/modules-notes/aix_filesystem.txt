> AIX_FILESYSTEM    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/aix_filesystem.py)

        This module creates, removes, mount and unmount LVM and NFS file system for AIX using `/etc/filesystems'. For LVM file systems is
        possible to resize a file system.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- account_subsystem
        Specifies whether the file system is to be processed by the accounting subsystem.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- attributes
        Specifies attributes for files system separated by comma.
        [Default: agblksize='4096',isnapshot='no']
        type: list

- auto_mount
        File system is automatically mounted at system restart.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- device
        Logical volume (LV) device name or remote export device to create a NFS file system.
        It is used to create a file system on an already existing logical volume or the exported NFS file system.
        If not mentioned a new logical volume name will be created following AIX standards (LVM).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= filesystem
        Specifies the mount point, which is the directory where the file system will be mounted.

        type: str

- fs_type
        Specifies the virtual file system type.
        [Default: jfs2]
        type: str

- mount_group
        Specifies the mount group.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- nfs_server
        Specifies a Network File System (NFS) server.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- permissions
        Set file system permissions. `rw' (read-write) or `ro' (read-only).
        (Choices: ro, rw)[Default: rw]
        type: str

- rm_mount_point
        Removes the mount point directory when used with state `absent'.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- size
        Specifies the file system size.
        For already `present' it will be resized.
        512-byte blocks, Megabytes or Gigabytes. If the value has M specified it will be in Megabytes. If the value has G specified it
        will be in Gigabytes.
        If no M or G the value will be 512-byte blocks.
        If "+" is specified in begin of value, the value will be added.
        If "-" is specified in begin of value, the value will be removed.
        If "+" or "-" is not specified, the total value will be the specified.
        Size will respects the LVM AIX standards.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= state
        Controls the file system state.
        `present' check if file system exists, creates or resize.
        `absent' removes existing file system if already `unmounted'.
        `mounted' checks if the file system is mounted or mount the file system.
        `unmounted' check if the file system is unmounted or unmount the file system.
        (Choices: absent, mounted, present, unmounted)[Default: present]
        type: str

- vg
        Specifies an existing volume group (VG).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

      * For more `attributes', please check "crfs" AIX manual.
