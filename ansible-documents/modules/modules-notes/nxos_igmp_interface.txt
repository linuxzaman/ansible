> NXOS_IGMP_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/nxos/nxos_igmp_interface.py)

        Manages IGMP interface configuration settings.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- group_timeout
        Sets the group membership timeout for IGMPv2. Values can range from 3 to 65,535 seconds or keyword 'default'. The default is 260
        seconds.
        [Default: (null)]

- immediate_leave
        Enables the device to remove the group entry from the multicast routing table immediately upon receiving a leave message for the
        group. Use this command to minimize the leave latency of IGMPv2 group memberships on a given IGMP interface because the device
        does not send group-specific queries. The default is disabled.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= interface
        The full interface name for IGMP configuration. e.g. `Ethernet1/2'.


- last_member_qrt
        Sets the query interval waited after sending membership reports before the software deletes the group state. Values can range
        from 1 to 25 seconds or keyword 'default'. The default is 1 second.
        [Default: (null)]

- last_member_query_count
        Sets the number of times that the software sends an IGMP query in response to a host leave message. Values can range from 1 to 5
        or keyword 'default'. The default is 2.
        [Default: (null)]

- oif_prefix
        This argument is deprecated, please use oif_ps instead. Configure a prefix for static outgoing interface (OIF).
        [Default: (null)]

- oif_ps
        Configure prefixes and sources for static outgoing interface (OIF). This is a list of dict where each dict has source and prefix
        defined or just prefix if source is not needed. The specified values will be configured on the device and if any previous
        prefix/sources exist, they will be removed. Keyword 'default' is also accpted which removes all existing prefix/sources.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.6
        

- oif_routemap
        Configure a routemap for static outgoing interface (OIF) or keyword 'default'.
        [Default: (null)]

- oif_source
        This argument is deprecated, please use oif_ps instead. Configure a source for static outgoing interface (OIF).
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).

            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,

            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              argument is only used for the `cli' transport. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will
              be used instead.

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return
              on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).

- report_llg
        Configures report-link-local-groups. Enables sending reports for groups in 224.0.0.0/24. Reports are always sent for nonlink
        local groups. By default, reports are not sent for link local groups.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- restart
        Restart IGMP. This is NOT idempotent as this is action only.

        Query count used when the IGMP process starts up. The range is from 1 to 10 or keyword 'default'. The default is 2.
        [Default: (null)]

- startup_query_interval

        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Manages desired state of the resource.
        (Choices: present, absent, default)[Default: present]

        IGMP version. It can be 2 or 3 or keyword 'default'.
        (Choices: 2, 3, default)[Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
      * When `state=default', supported params will be reset to a default state. These include `version', `startup_query_interval',
        `startup_query_count', `robustness', `querier_timeout', `query_mrt', `query_interval', `last_member_qrt',
        `last_member_query_count', `group_timeout', `report_llg', and `immediate_leave'.
      * When `state=absent', all configs for `oif_ps', and `oif_routemap' will be removed.
      * PIM must be enabled to use this module.
      * This module is for Layer 3 interfaces.
      * Route-map check not performed (same as CLI) check when configuring route-map with 'static-oif'
      * If restart is set to true with other params set, the restart will happen last, i.e. after the configuration takes place.
        However, 'restart' itself is not idempotent as it is an action and not configuration.
