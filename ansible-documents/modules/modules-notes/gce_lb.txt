> GCE_LB    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gce_lb.py)

        This module can create and destroy Google Compute Engine `loadbalancer' and `httphealthcheck' resources.  The primary LB resource
        is the `load_balancer' resource and the health check parameters are all prefixed with `httphealthcheck'. The full documentation
        for Google Compute Engine load balancing is at https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.  However, the ansible
        module simplifies the configuration by following the libcloud model. Full install/configuration instructions for the gce* modules
        can be found in the comments of ansible/test/gce_tests.py.
