> WIN_HOSTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_hosts.py)

        Manages hosts file entries on Windows. Maps IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to canonical names Adds, removes, or sets cname records for ip
        and hostname pairs Modifies %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- action
        Controls the behavior of `aliases'.
        Only applicable when `state=present'.
        If `add', each alias in `aliases' will be added to the host entry.
        If `set', each alias in `aliases' will be added to the host entry, and other aliases will be removed from the entry.
        (Choices: add, remove, set)[Default: set]

- aliases
        A list of additional names (cname records) for the host entry.
        Only applicable when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- canonical_name
        A canonical name for the host entry.
        required for `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- ip_address
        The ip address for the host entry.
        Can be either IPv4 (A record) or IPv6 (AAAA record).
        Required for `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Whether the entry should be present or absent.
        If only `canonical_name' is provided when `state=absent', then all hosts entries with the canonical name of `canonical_name' will
        be removed.
        If only `ip_address' is provided when `state=absent', then all hosts entries with the ip address of `ip_address' will be removed.
        If `ip_address' and `canonical_name' are both omitted when `state=absent', then all hosts entries will be removed.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * Each canonical name can only be mapped to one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. If `canonical_name' is provided with
        `state=present' and is found to be mapped to another IP address that is the same type as, but unique from `ip_address',
        then `canonical_name' and all `aliases' will be removed from the entry and added to an entry with the provided IP address.
      * Each alias can only be mapped to one canonical name. If `aliases' is provided with `state=present' and an alias is found to
        be mapped to another canonical name, then the alias will be removed from the entry and added to or removed from (based on
        `action') an entry with the provided canonical name.
