> PACKAGE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/packaging/os/package.py)

        Installs, upgrade and removes packages using the underlying OS package manager. For Windows targets, use the [win_package] module
        instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= name
        Package name, or package specifier with version, like `name-1.0'.
        Be aware that packages are not always named the same and this module will not 'translate' them per distro.


= state
        Whether to install (`present'), or remove (`absent') a package. Other states depend on the underlying package module, i.e
        `latest'.


- use
        The required package manager module to use (yum, apt, etc). The default 'auto' will use existing facts or try to autodetect it.
        You should only use this field if the automatic selection is not working for some reason.
        [Default: auto]


NOTES:
      * This module actually calls the pertinent package modules for each system (apt, yum, etc).
      * For Windows targets, use the [win_package] module instead.


REQUIREMENTS:  Whatever is required for the package plugins specific for each system.
