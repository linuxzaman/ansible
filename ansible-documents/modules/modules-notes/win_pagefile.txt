        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- maximum_size
        The maximum size of the pagefile in megabytes.
        [Default: (null)]

        [Default: True]

NOTES:
      * There is difference between automatic managed pagefiles that configured once for the entire system and system managed
        pagefile that configured per pagefile.
      * InitialSize 0 and MaximumSize 0 means the pagefile is managed by the system.
      * Value out of range exception may be caused by several different issues, two common problems - No such drive, Pagefile size
        is too small.
      * Setting a pagefile when AutomaticManagedPagefile is on will disable the AutomaticManagedPagefile.
