> PANOS_NAT_RULE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/panos/_panos_nat_rule.py)

        - Create a policy nat rule. Keep in mind that we can either end up configuring source NAT, destination NAT, or both. Instead of
        splitting it into two we will make a fair attempt to determine which one the user wants.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Consolidating code base.
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use U(https://galaxy.ansible.com/PaloAltoNetworks/paloaltonetworks) instead.
