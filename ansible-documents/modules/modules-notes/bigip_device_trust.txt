> BIGIP_DEVICE_TRUST    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_trust.py)

        Manage the trust relationships between BIG-IPs. Devices, once peered, cannot be updated. If updating is needed, the peer must
        first be removed before it can be re-added to the trust.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- peer_hostname
        The hostname that you want to associate with the device. This value will be used to easily distinguish this device in BIG-IP
        configuration.
        When trusting a new device, if this parameter is not specified, the value of `peer_server' will be used as a default.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- peer_password
        The password of the API username of the remote peer device that you are trusting. If this value is not specified, then the value
        of `password', or the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= peer_server
        The peer address to connect to and trust for synchronizing configuration. This is typically the management address of the remote
        device, but may also be a Self IP.

        type: str

- peer_user
        The API username of the remote peer device that you are trusting. Note that the CLI user cannot be used unless it too has an API
        account. If this value is not specified, then the value of `user', or the environment variable `F5_USER' will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]

            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This argument is only used for `cli' transports.
            - You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.

= server
        The BIG-IP host.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.

- state
        When `present', ensures the specified devices are trusted.
        When `absent', removes the device trusts.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- type
        Specifies whether the device you are adding is a Peer or a Subordinate. The default is `peer'.
        The difference between the two is a matter of mitigating risk of compromise.
        A subordinate device cannot sign a certificate for another device.
        In the case where the security of an authority device in a trust domain is compromised, the risk of compromise is minimized for
        any subordinate device.
        Designating devices as subordinate devices is recommended for device groups with a large number of member devices, where the risk
        of compromise is high.
        (Choices: peer, subordinate)[Default: peer]
        type: str

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
