> FORTIOS_ROUTER_BGP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_router_bgp.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify router feature and bgp category.
        Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
