> FMGR_FWOBJ_ADDRESS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortimanager/fmgr_fwobj_address.py)

        Allows for the management of IPv4, IPv6, and multicast address objects within FortiManager.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- adom
        The ADOM the configuration should belong to.
        [Default: root]

- allow_routing
        Enable/disable use of this address in the static route configuration.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: disable]

- associated_interface
        Associated interface name.
        [Default: (null)]

- cache_ttl
        Minimal TTL of individual IP addresses in FQDN cache. Only applies when type = wildcard-fqdn.
        [Default: (null)]

- color
        Color of the object in FortiManager GUI.
        Takes integers 1-32
        [Default: 22]

- comment
        Comment for the object in FortiManager.
        [Default: (null)]

- country
        Country name. Required if type = geographic.
        [Default: (null)]

- end_ip
        End IP. Only used when ipv4 = iprange.
        [Default: (null)]

- fqdn
        Fully qualified domain name.
        [Default: (null)]

- group_members
        Address group member. If this is defined w/out group_name, the operation will fail.
        [Default: (null)]

- group_name
        Address group name. If this is defined in playbook task, all other options are ignored.
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv4
        Type of IPv4 Object.
        Must not be specified with either multicast or IPv6 parameters.
        (Choices: ipmask, iprange, fqdn, wildcard, geography, wildcard-fqdn, group)[Default: (null)]

- ipv4addr
        IP and network mask. If only defining one IP use this parameter. (i.e. 10.7.220.30/255.255.255.255)
        Can also define subnets (i.e. 10.7.220.0/255.255.255.0)
        Also accepts CIDR (i.e. 10.7.220.0/24)
        If Netmask is omitted after IP address, /32 is assumed.
        When multicast is set to Broadcast Subnet the ipv4addr parameter is used to specify the subnet.
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv6
        Puts module into IPv6 mode.
        Must not be specified with either ipv4 or multicast parameters.
        (Choices: ip, iprange, group)[Default: (null)]

- ipv6addr
        IPv6 address in full. (i.e. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
        [Default: (null)]

- mode
        Sets one of three modes for managing the object.
        (Choices: add, set, delete)[Default: add]

- multicast
        Manages Multicast Address Objects.
        Sets either a Multicast IP Range or a Broadcast Subnet.
        Must not be specified with either ipv4 or ipv6 parameters.
        When set to Broadcast Subnet the ipv4addr parameter is used to specify the subnet.
        Can create IPv4 Multicast Objects (multicastrange and broadcastmask options -- uses start/end-ip and ipv4addr).
        (Choices: multicastrange, broadcastmask, ip6)[Default: (null)]

- name
        Friendly Name Address object name in FortiManager.
        [Default: (null)]

- obj_id
        Object ID for NSX.
        [Default: (null)]

- start_ip
        Start IP. Only used when ipv4 = iprange.
        [Default: (null)]

- visibility
        Enable/disable address visibility.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: enable]

- wildcard
        IP address and wildcard netmask. Required if ipv4 = wildcard.
        [Default: (null)]

- wildcard_fqdn
        Wildcard FQDN. Required if ipv4 = wildcard-fqdn.
        [Default: (null)]
