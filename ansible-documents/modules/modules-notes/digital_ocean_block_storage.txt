  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- block_size
        The size of the Block Storage volume in gigabytes. Required when command=create and state=present. If snapshot_id is included,
        this will be ignored.
        [Default: (null)]

= command
        Which operation do you want to perform.
        (Choices: create, attach)

- description
        Description of the Block Storage volume.
        [Default: (null)]

- droplet_id
        The droplet id you want to operate on. Required when command=attach.
        [Default: (null)]

- oauth_token
        DigitalOcean OAuth token.
        There are several other environment variables which can be used to provide this value.
        i.e., - 'DO_API_TOKEN', 'DO_API_KEY', 'DO_OAUTH_TOKEN' and 'OAUTH_TOKEN'
        (Aliases: api_token)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

= region
        The slug of the region where your Block Storage volume should be located in. If snapshot_id is included, this will be ignored.


- snapshot_id
        The snapshot id you would like the Block Storage volume created with. If included, region and block_size will be ignored and
        changed to null.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.5

= state
        Indicate desired state of the target.
        (Choices: present, absent)

- timeout
        The timeout in seconds used for polling DigitalOcean's API.
        [Default: 30]
        type: int

- validate_certs
        If set to `no', the SSL certificates will not be validated.
        This should only set to `no' used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

= volume_name
        The name of the Block Storage volume.



NOTES:
      * Two environment variables can be used, DO_API_KEY and DO_API_TOKEN. They both refer to the v2 token.
      * If snapshot_id is used, region and block_size will be ignored and changed to null.
