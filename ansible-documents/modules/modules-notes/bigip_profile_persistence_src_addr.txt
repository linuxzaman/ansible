        Manages source address persistence profiles.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- entry_timeout
        Specifies the duration of the persistence entries.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        To specify an indefinite timeout, use the value `indefinite'.
        If specifying a numeric timeout, the value must be between `1' and `4294967295'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- hash_algorithm
        Specifies the algorithm the system uses for hash persistence load balancing. The hash result is the input for the algorithm.
        When `default', specifies that the system uses the index of pool members to obtain the hash result for the input to the
        algorithm.
        When `carp', specifies that the system uses the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) to obtain the hash result for the input to
        the algorithm.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        (Choices: default, carp)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- match_across_pools
        When `yes', specifies that the system can use any pool that contains this persistence record.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- match_across_services
        When `yes', specifies that all persistent connections from a client IP address that go to the same virtual IP address also go to
        the same node.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- match_across_virtuals
        When `yes', specifies that all persistent connections from the same client IP address go to the same node.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        Specifies the name of the profile.

        type: str

- override_connection_limit
        When `yes', specifies that the system allows you to specify that pool member connection limits will be overridden for persisted
        clients.
        Per-virtual connection limits remain hard limits and are not overridden.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- parent
        Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied `source_addr' profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
