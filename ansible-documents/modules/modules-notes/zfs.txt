> ZFS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/storage/zfs/zfs.py)

        Manages ZFS file systems, volumes, clones and snapshots

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- extra_zfs_properties
        A dictionary of zfs properties to be set.
        See the zfs(8) man page for more information.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.5

- key_value
        (**DEPRECATED**) This will be removed in Ansible-2.9.  Set these values in the
        `extra_zfs_properties' option instead.
        The `zfs' module takes key=value pairs for zfs properties to be set.
        See the zfs(8) man page for more information.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        File system, snapshot or volume name e.g. `rpool/myfs'.


- origin
        Snapshot from which to create a clone.
        [Default: (null)]

= state
        Whether to create (`present'), or remove (`absent') a file system, snapshot or volume. All parents/children will be
        created/destroyed as needed to reach the desired state.
        (Choices: absent, present)
