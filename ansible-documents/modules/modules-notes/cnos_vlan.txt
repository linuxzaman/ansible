        This module provides declarative management of VLANs on Lenovo CNOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of VLANs definitions.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8

- associated_interfaces
        This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vlan `name' for associated interfaces. If the value in
        the `associated_interfaces' does not match with the operational state of vlan interfaces on device it will result in failure.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8

- delay
        Delay the play should wait to check for declarative intent params values.
        [Default: 10]
        version_added: 2.8

= interfaces
        List of interfaces that should be associated to the VLAN.

        version_added: 2.8

- name
        Name of the VLAN.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(CNOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_cnos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.
          authorize:
            default: 'no'
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
