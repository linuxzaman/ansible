> NXOS_EVPN_VNI    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/nxos/nxos_evpn_vni.py)

        Manages Cisco Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) configurations of a Nexus device.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
            version_added: 2.5.3
          authorize:
            default: false
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
            version_added: 2.5.3
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              is a common argument used for either `cli' or `nxapi' transports. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 0 (use common port)
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,
              http=80, https=443).
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              argument is only used for the `cli' transport. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return
              on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
            type: int
            version_added: '2.3'

            choices:
            - cli
            - nxapi
            default: cli
            description:
            - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.  The
              transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or nxapi.
            required: true
            type: str
          use_proxy:
            default: true
            description:
            - If `no', the environment variables `http_proxy' and `https_proxy' will be
              ignored.
            type: bool
            version_added: '2.5'
          use_ssl:
            default: false
            description:
            - Configures the `transport' to use SSL if set to `yes' only when the `transport=nxapi',
              otherwise this value is ignored.
            type: bool
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          validate_certs:
            default: true
            description:
            - If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on
              personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
              argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
            type: bool
        
        type: dict

= route_distinguisher
        The VPN Route Distinguisher (RD). The RD is combined with the IPv4 or IPv6 prefix learned by the PE router to create a globally
        unique address.


- route_target_both
        Enables/Disables route-target settings for both import and export target communities using a single property.
        [Default: (null)]

- route_target_export
        Sets the route-target 'export' extended communities.
        [Default: (null)]

- route_target_import
        Sets the route-target 'import' extended communities.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Determines whether the config should be present or not on the device.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

= vni
        The EVPN VXLAN Network Identifier.



NOTES:
      * Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
      * default, where supported, restores params default value.
      * RD override is not permitted. You should set it to the default values first and then reconfigure it.
      * `route_target_both', `route_target_import' and `route_target_export valid' values are a list of extended communities, (i.e.
        ['1.2.3.4:5', '33:55']) or the keywords 'auto' or 'default'.
      * The `route_target_both' property is discouraged due to the inconsistent behavior of the property across Nexus platforms and
        image versions. For this reason it is recommended to use explicit `route_target_export' and `route_target_import'
        properties instead of `route_target_both'.
      * RD valid values are a string in one of the route-distinguisher formats, the keyword 'auto', or the keyword 'default'.
