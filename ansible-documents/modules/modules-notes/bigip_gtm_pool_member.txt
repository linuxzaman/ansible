> BIGIP_GTM_POOL_MEMBER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_gtm_pool_member.py)

        Manages a variety of settings on GTM pool members. The settings that can be adjusted with this module are much more broad that
        what can be done in the `bigip_gtm_pool' module. The pool module is intended to allow you to adjust the member order in the pool,
        not the various settings of the members. The `bigip_gtm_pool_member' module should be used to adjust all of the other settings.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of GTM pool member definitions to be created, modified or removed.
        (Aliases: members)[Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.8
        

- description
        The description of the pool member.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- limits
        Specifies resource thresholds or limit requirements at the pool member level.
        When you enable one or more limit settings, the system then uses that data to take members in and out of service.
        You can define limits for any or all of the limit settings. However, when a member does not meet the resource threshold limit
        requirement, the system marks the member as unavailable and directs load-balancing traffic to another resource.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          bits_enabled:
            description:
            - Whether the bits limit it enabled or not.
            - This parameter allows you to switch on or off the effect of the limit.
            type: bool
          bits_limit:
            description:
            - Specifies the maximum allowable data throughput rate, in bits per second, for
              the member.
            - If the network traffic volume exceeds this limit, the system marks the member
              as unavailable.
            type: int
          connections_enabled:
            description:
            - Whether the current connections limit it enabled or not.
            - This parameter allows you to switch on or off the effect of the limit.
            type: bool
          connections_limit:
            description:
            - Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections, combined, for all of
              the member.
            - If the connections exceed this limit, the system marks the server as unavailable.
            type: int
          packets_enabled:
            description:
            - Whether the packets limit it enabled or not.
            - This parameter allows you to switch on or off the effect of the limit.
            type: bool
          packets_limit:
            description:
            - Specifies the maximum allowable data transfer rate, in packets per second, for
              the member.
            - If the network traffic volume exceeds this limit, the system marks the member
              as unavailable.
            type: int
        
        type: dict

- member_order
        Specifies the order in which the member will appear in the pool.
        The system uses this number with load balancing methods that involve prioritizing pool members, such as the Ratio load balancing
        method.
        When creating a new member using this module, if the `member_order' parameter is not specified, it will default to `0' (first
        member in the pool).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- monitor
        Specifies the monitor assigned to this pool member.
        Pool members only support a single monitor.
        If the `port' of the `gtm_virtual_server' is `*', the accepted values of this parameter will be affected.
        When creating a new pool member, if this parameter is not specified, the default of `default' will be used.
        To remove the monitor from the pool member, use the value `none'.
        For pool members created on different partitions, you can also specify the full path to the Common monitor. For example,
        `/Common/tcp'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- partition

        [Default: Common]
        type: str

        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

= pool
        Name of the GTM pool.
        For pools created on different partitions, you must specify partition of the pool in the full path format, for example,
        `/FooBar/pool_name'.

        type: str

          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          transport:
            choices:
            - cli
            - rest

              sites using self-signed certificates.
            - You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
            type: bool
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.5

- ratio
        Specifies the weight of the pool member for load balancing purposes.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= server

        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

= server_name
        Specifies the GTM server which contains the `virtual_server'.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- state
        Pool member state. When `present', ensures that the pool member is created and enabled. When `absent', ensures that the pool
        member is removed from the system. When `enabled' or `disabled', ensures that the pool member is enabled or disabled
        (respectively) on the remote device.
        It is recommended that you use the `members' parameter of the `bigip_gtm_pool' module when adding and removing members and it
        provides an easier way of specifying order. If this is not possible, then the `state' parameter here should be used.
        Remember that the order of the members will be affected if you add or remove them using this method. To some extent, this can be
        controlled using the `member_order' parameter.
        (Choices: present, absent, enabled, disabled)[Default: present]
        type: str

= type

        type: str

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0

= virtual_server
        Specifies the name of the GTM virtual server which is assigned to the specified `server'.

        type: str


NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
