> GCDNS_ZONE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/_gcdns_zone.py)

        Creates or removes managed zones in Google Cloud DNS.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Updated modules released with increased functionality
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use M(gcp_dns_managed_zone) instead.


  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- credentials_file
        The path to the JSON file associated with the service account email.
        [Default: (null)]

- description
        An arbitrary text string to use for the zone description.
        [Default: ]

- pem_file
        The path to the PEM file associated with the service account email.
        This option is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Use `credentials_file' instead.
        [Default: (null)]

- project_id
        The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use.
        [Default: (null)]

- service_account_email
        The e-mail address for a service account with access to Google Cloud DNS.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Whether the given zone should or should not be present.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

= zone
        The DNS domain name of the zone.
        This is NOT the Google Cloud DNS zone ID (e.g., example-com). If you attempt to specify a zone ID, this module will attempt to
        create a TLD and will fail.
        (Aliases: name)


NOTES:
      * See also [gcdns_record].
      * Zones that are newly created must still be set up with a domain registrar before they can be used.


REQUIREMENTS:  apache-libcloud >= 0.19.0
