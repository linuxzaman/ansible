EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Create(if not exists) and assign tag to vms vm1 and vm2:
- ovirt_tag:
    name: mytag
    vms:
      - vm1
      - vm2

# Attach a tag to VM 'vm3', keeping the rest already attached tags on VM:
- ovirt_tag:
    name: mytag
    state: attached
    vms:
      - vm3

# Detach a tag from VM 'vm3', keeping the rest already attached tags on VM:
- ovirt_tag:
    name: mytag
    state: detached
    vms:
      - vm3

# To detach all VMs from tag:
- ovirt_tag:
    name: mytag
    vms: []

# Remove tag
- ovirt_tag:
    state: absent
    name: mytag

# Change Tag Name
- ovirt_tag:
    id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    name: "new_tag_name"
