        This module can install new and updated packages on remote devices running Junos.  The module will compare the specified package
        with the one running on the remote device and install the specified version if there is a mismatch

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- force
        The `force' argument instructs the module to bypass the package version check and install the packaged identified in `src' on the
        remote device.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- force_host
        The `force_host' argument controls the way software package or bundle is added on remote JUNOS host and is applicable for JUNOS
        QFX5100 device. If the value is set to `True' it will ignore any warnings while adding the host software package or bundle.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8
        

- issu
        The `issu' argument is a boolean flag when set to `True' allows unified in-service software upgrade (ISSU) feature which enables
        you to upgrade between two different Junos OS releases with no disruption on the control plane and with minimal disruption of
        traffic.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8
        

- no_copy
        The `no_copy' argument is responsible for instructing the remote device on where to install the package from.  When enabled, the
        package is transferred to the remote device prior to installing.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' or `connection: netconf'.
        For more information please see the L(Junos OS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  The
              port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for `transport=cli')
              or port 830 (for `transport=netconf') device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict

- reboot
        In order for a package to take effect, the remote device must be restarted.  When enabled, this argument will instruct the module
        to reboot the device once the updated package has been installed. If disabled or the remote package does not need to be changed,
        the device will not be started.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

= src
        The `src' argument specifies the path to the source package to be installed on the remote device in the advent of a version
        mismatch. The `src' argument can be either a localized path or a full path to the package file to install.
        (Aliases: package)

- validate
        The `validate' argument is responsible for instructing the remote device to skip checking the current device configuration
        compatibility with the package being installed. When set to false validation is not performed.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5
        

- version
        The `version' argument can be used to explicitly specify the version of the package that should be installed on the remote
        device.  If the `version' argument is not specified, then the version is extracts from the `src' filename.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
      * Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
      * Works with `local' connections only.
      * For information on using CLI and netconf see the :ref:`Junos OS Platform Options guide <junos_platform_options>`
