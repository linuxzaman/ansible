> IOS_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/ios/ios_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running IOS.  This module prepends all of the base network fact
        keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or
        disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument restricts the facts collected to a given subset.
        Possible values for this argument include `all', `hardware', `config', and `interfaces'.
        Specify a list of values to include a larger subset.
        Use a value with an initial `!' to collect all facts except that subset.
        [Default: !config]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
