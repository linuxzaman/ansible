NOTES:
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_file using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the `GCP_AUTH_KIND' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set scopes using the `GCP_SCOPES' env variable.
      * Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
      * The `service_account_email' and `service_account_file' options are mutually exclusive.
