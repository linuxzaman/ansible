> IOS_LOGGING    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/ios/ios_logging.py)

        This module provides declarative management of logging on Cisco Ios devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of logging definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- dest
        Destination of the logs.
        (Choices: on, host, console, monitor, buffered)[Default: (null)]

- facility
        Set logging facility.
        [Default: (null)]

- level
        Set logging severity levels.
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        If value of `dest' is `file' it indicates file-name, for `user' it indicates username and for `host' indicates the host name to
        be notified.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          authorize:
            default: false
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
