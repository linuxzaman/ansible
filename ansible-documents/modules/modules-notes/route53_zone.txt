NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  boto, boto3, python >= 2.6
