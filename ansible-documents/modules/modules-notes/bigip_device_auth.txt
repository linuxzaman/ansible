> BIGIP_DEVICE_AUTH    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_auth.py)

        Manage the system authentication configuration. This module can assist in configuring a number of different system authentication
        types. Note that this module can not be used to configure APM authentication types.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- authentication
        Specifies the process the system employs when sending authentication requests.
        When `use-first-server', specifies that the system sends authentication attempts to only the first server in the list.
        When `use-all-servers', specifies that the system sends an authentication request to each server until authentication succeeds,
        or until the system has sent a request to all servers in the list.
        This parameter is supported by the `tacacs' type.
        (Choices: use-first-server, use-all-servers)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.

        type: str

- protocol_name
        Specifies the protocol associated with the value specified in `service_name', which is a subset of the associated service being
        used for client authorization or system accounting.
        Note that the majority of TACACS+ implementations are of protocol type `ip', so try that first.
        (Choices: lcp, ip, ipx, atalk, vines, lat, xremote, tn3270, telnet, rlogin, pad, vpdn, ftp, http, deccp, osicp, unknown)[Default:

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for

- secret
        Secret key used to encrypt and decrypt packets sent or received from the server.
        *Do not* use the pound/hash sign in the secret for TACACS+ servers.
        When configuring TACACS+ auth for the first time, this value is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

        which the system communicates to obtain authorization data.
        For each address, an alternate TCP port number may be optionally specified by specifying the `port' key.
        If no port number is specified, the default port `49163' is used.
        This parameter is supported by the `tacacs' type.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          address:
            description:
            - The IP address of the server.
            - This field is required, unless you are specifying a simple list of servers.
              In that case, the simple list can specify server IPs. See examples for more
              clarification.
          port:
            default: 49163
            description:
            - The port of the server.
        
        type: raw

- service_name
        Specifies the name of the service that the user is requesting to be authorized to use.
        Identifying what the user is asking to be authorized for, enables the TACACS+ server to behave differently for different types of
        authorization requests.
        When configuring this form of system authentication, this setting is required.
        Note that the majority of TACACS+ implementations are of service type `ppp', so try that first.
        (Choices: slip, ppp, arap, shell, tty-daemon, connection, system, firewall)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        The state of the authentication configuration on the system.
        When `present', guarantees that the system is configured for the specified `type'.
        When `absent', sets the system auth source back to `local'.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- type
        The authentication type to manage with this module.
        Take special note that the parameters supported by this module will vary depending on the `type' that you are configuring.
        This module only supports a subset, at this time, of the total available auth types.
        (Choices: tacacs, local)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- update_secret
        `always' will allow to update secrets if the user chooses to do so.
        `on_create' will only set the secret when a `use_auth_source' is `yes' and TACACS+ is not currently the auth source.
        (Choices: always, on_create)[Default: always]
        type: str

- use_for_auth
        Specifies whether or not this auth source is put in use on the system.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
