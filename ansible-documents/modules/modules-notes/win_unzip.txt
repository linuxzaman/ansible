> WIN_UNZIP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_unzip.py)

        Unzips compressed files and archives. Supports .zip files natively. Supports other formats supported by the Powershell Community
        Extensions (PSCX) module (basically everything 7zip supports). For non-Windows targets, use the [unarchive] module instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- creates
        If this file or directory exists the specified src will not be extracted.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- delete_archive
        Remove the zip file, after unzipping.
        (Aliases: rm)[Default: False]
        type: bool

= dest
        Destination of zip file (provide absolute path of directory). If it does not exist, the directory will be created.

        type: path

- recurse
        Recursively expand zipped files within the src file.
        Setting to a value of `yes' requires the PSCX module to be installed.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= src
        File to be unzipped (provide absolute path).

        type: path


NOTES:
      * This module is not really idempotent, it will extract the archive every time, and report a change.
      * For extracting any compression types other than .zip, the PowerShellCommunityExtensions (PSCX) Module is required.  This
        module (in conjunction with PSCX) has the ability to recursively unzip files within the src zip file provided and also
        functionality for many other compression types. If the destination directory does not exist, it will be created before
        unzipping the file.  Specifying rm parameter will force removal of the src file after extraction.
