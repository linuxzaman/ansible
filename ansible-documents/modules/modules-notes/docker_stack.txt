> DOCKER_STACK    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/docker/docker_stack.py)

        Manage docker stacks using the 'docker stack' command on the target node (see examples).

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- absent_retries
        If `>0' and `state==absent' the module will retry up to `absent_retries' times to delete the stack until all the resources have
        been effectively deleted. If the last try still reports the stack as not completely removed the module will fail.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int

- absent_retries_interval
        Interval in seconds between `absent_retries'
        [Default: 1]
        type: int

- compose
        List of compose definitions. Any element may be a string referring to the path of the compose file on the target host or the YAML
        contents of a compose file nested as dictionary.
        [Default: []]
        type: list

= name
        Stack name

        type: str

- prune
        If true will add the `--prune' option to the `docker stack deploy' command. This will have docker remove the services not present
        in the current stack definition.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- resolve_image
        If set will add the `--resolve-image' option to the `docker stack deploy' command. This will have docker query the registry to
        resolve image digest and supported platforms. If not set, docker use "always" by default.
        (Choices: always, changed, never)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        Service state.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]
        type: str

- with_registry_auth
        If true will add the `--with-registry-auth' option to the `docker stack deploy' command. This will have docker send registry
        authentication details to Swarm agents.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
