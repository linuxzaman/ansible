> NXOS_L2_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/nxos/nxos_l2_interface.py)

        This module provides declarative management of Layer-2 interface on Cisco NXOS devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- access_vlan
        Configure given VLAN in access port. If `mode=access', used as the access VLAN ID.
        [Default: (null)]

- aggregate
        List of Layer-2 interface definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- mode
        Mode in which interface needs to be configured.
        (Choices: access, trunk)[Default: (null)]

= name
        Full name of the interface excluding any logical unit number, i.e. Ethernet1/1.
        (Aliases: interface)

- native_vlan
        Native VLAN to be configured in trunk port. If `mode=trunk', used as the trunk native VLAN ID.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.

        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
            version_added: 2.5.3
          authorize:
            default: false
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
            version_added: 2.5.3
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              is a common argument used for either `cli' or `nxapi' transports. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 0 (use common port)
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,
              http=80, https=443).
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              argument is only used for the `cli' transport. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return
              on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).

            default: cli
            description:
            - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.  The
              transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or nxapi.

            type: str
          use_proxy:
            default: true
            description:
            - If `no', the environment variables `http_proxy' and `https_proxy' will be
              ignored.

          use_ssl:
            default: false
            description:
            - Configures the `transport' to use SSL if set to `yes' only when the `transport=nxapi',
              otherwise this value is ignored.
            type: bool
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME' will
              be used instead.

              personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
              argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
            type: bool
        
        type: dict

- state
        Manage the state of the Layer-2 Interface configuration.
        (Choices: present, absent, unconfigured)[Default: present]

- trunk_allowed_vlans
        List of allowed VLANs in a given trunk port. If `mode=trunk', these are the only VLANs that will be configured on the trunk, i.e.
        "2-10,15".
        [Default: (null)]

- trunk_vlans
        List of VLANs to be configured in trunk port. If `mode=trunk', used as the VLAN range to ADD or REMOVE from the trunk.
        (Aliases: trunk_add_vlans)[Default: (null)]
