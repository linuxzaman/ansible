        Arbiter count for volume.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

- bricks
        Brick paths on servers. Multiple brick paths can be separated by commas.
        (Aliases: brick)[Default: (null)]

- cluster
        List of hosts to use for probing and brick setup.
        [Default: (null)]

- directory
        Directory for limit-usage.
        [Default: (null)]

- disperses
        Disperse count for volume.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.2

- force
        If brick is being created in the root partition, module will fail. Set force to true to override this behaviour.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- host
        Override local hostname (for peer probing purposes).
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        The volume name.
        (Aliases: volume)

- options
        A dictionary/hash with options/settings for the volume.
        [Default: (null)]

- quota
        Quota value for limit-usage (be sure to use 10.0MB instead of 10MB, see quota list).
        [Default: (null)]

- rebalance
        Controls whether the cluster is rebalanced after changes.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- redundancies
        Redundancy count for volume.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.2

- replicas
        Replica count for volume.
        [Default: (null)]

- start_on_create
        Controls whether the volume is started after creation or not.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

= state
        Use present/absent ensure if a volume exists or not. Use started/stopped to control its availability.
        (Choices: absent, present, started, stopped)

- stripes
        Stripe count for volume.
        [Default: (null)]

- transport
        Transport type for volume.
        (Choices: tcp, rdma, tcp,rdma)[Default: tcp]
