        Add or remove domains or subdomains on a Webfaction host. Further documentation at https://github.com/quentinsf/ansible-
        webfaction.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= login_name
        The webfaction account to use


= login_password
        The webfaction password to use


= name
        The name of the domain


- state
        Whether the domain should exist
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subdomains
        Any subdomains to create.
        [Default: []]


NOTES:
      * If you are `deleting' domains by using `state=absent', then note that if you specify subdomains, just those particular
        subdomains will be deleted. If you don't specify subdomains, the domain will be deleted.
      * You can run playbooks that use this on a local machine, or on a Webfaction host, or elsewhere, since the scripts use the
        remote webfaction API. The location is not important. However, running them on multiple hosts `simultaneously' is best
        avoided. If you don't specify `localhost' as your host, you may want to add `serial: 1' to the plays.
      * See `the webfaction API <https://docs.webfaction.com/xmlrpc-api/>`_ for more info.
