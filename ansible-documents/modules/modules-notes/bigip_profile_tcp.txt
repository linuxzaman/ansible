> BIGIP_PROFILE_TCP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_profile_tcp.py)

        Manage TCP profiles on a BIG-IP. Many TCP profiles; each with their own adjustments to the standard `tcp' profile. Users of this
        module should be aware that many of the adjustable knobs have no module default. Instead, the default is assigned by the BIG-IP
        system itself which, in most cases, is acceptable.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- idle_timeout
        Specifies the length of time that a connection is idle (has no traffic) before the connection is eligible for deletion.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the remote device will choose a default value appropriate for
        the profile, based on its `parent' profile.
        When a number is specified, indicates the number of seconds that the TCP connection can remain idle before the system deletes it.
        When `0', or `indefinite', specifies that the system does not delete TCP connections regardless of how long they remain idle.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        Specifies the name of the profile.

        type: str

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
