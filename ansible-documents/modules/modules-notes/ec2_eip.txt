> EC2_EIP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/amazon/ec2_eip.py)

        This module can allocate or release an EIP. This module can associate/disassociate an EIP with instances or network interfaces.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- allow_reassociation
        Specify this option to allow an Elastic IP address that is already associated with another network interface or instance to be
        re-associated with the specified instance or interface.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- device_id
        The id of the device for the EIP. Can be an EC2 Instance id or Elastic Network Interface (ENI) id.
        (Aliases: instance_id)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.0

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- in_vpc
        Allocate an EIP inside a VPC or not. Required if specifying an ENI.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.4

- private_ip_address
        The primary or secondary private IP address to associate with the Elastic IP address.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

- profile
        Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- public_ip
        The IP address of a previously allocated EIP.
        If present and device is specified, the EIP is associated with the device.
        If absent and device is specified, the EIP is disassociated from the device.
        (Aliases: ip)[Default: (null)]

- region
        The AWS region to use. If not specified then the value of the AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION environment variable, if any, is used. See
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region
        (Aliases: aws_region, ec2_region)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- release_on_disassociation
        whether or not to automatically release the EIP when it is disassociated
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0

- reuse_existing_ip_allowed
        Reuse an EIP that is not associated to a device (when available), instead of allocating a new one.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.6

- security_token
        AWS STS security token. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN or EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable is used.
        (Aliases: access_token)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- state
        If present, allocate an EIP or associate an existing EIP with a device.
        If absent, disassociate the EIP from the device and optionally release it.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- validate_certs
        When set to "no", SSL certificates will not be validated for boto versions >= 2.6.0.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.5


NOTES:
      * There may be a delay between the time the EIP is assigned and when the cloud instance is reachable via the new address. Use
        wait_for and pause to delay further playbook execution until the instance is reachable, if necessary.
      * This module returns multiple changed statuses on disassociation or release. It returns an overall status based on any
        changes occurring. It also returns individual changed statuses for disassociation and release.
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  python >= 2.6, boto
