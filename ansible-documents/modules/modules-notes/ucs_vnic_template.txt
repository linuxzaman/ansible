OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

        CDN Name used when cdn_source is set to user-defined.
        [Default: (null)]

- cdn_source
        CDN Source field.
        This can be one of the following options:
        vnic-name - Uses the vNIC template name of the vNIC instance as the CDN name. This is the default option.
        user-defined - Uses a user-defined CDN name for the vNIC template. If this option is chosen, cdn_name must also be provided.
        (Choices: vnic-name, user-defined)[Default: vnic-name]

- description
        A user-defined description of the vNIC template.
        Enter up to 256 characters.
        You can use any characters or spaces except the following:
        ` (accent mark),  (backslash), ^ (carat), " (double quote), = (equal sign), > (greater than), < (less than), or ' (single quote).
        (Aliases: descr)[Default: (null)]

- fabric
        The Fabric ID field specifying the fabric interconnect associated with vNICs created from this template.
        If you want fabric failover enabled on vNICs created from this template, use of of the following:"
        A-B to use Fabric A by default with failover enabled.
        B-A to use Fabric B by default with failover enabled.
        Do not enable vNIC fabric failover under the following circumstances:
        - If the Cisco UCS domain is running in Ethernet switch mode. vNIC fabric failover is not supported in that mode.
        - If you plan to associate one or more vNICs created from this template to a server with an adapter that does not support fabric
        failover.
        (Choices: A, B, A-B, B-A)[Default: A]

= hostname
        IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.

        type: str

        [Default: (null)]

- mtu
        The MTU field.
        The maximum transmission unit, or packet size, that vNICs created from this vNIC template should use.
        Enter a string between '1500' and '9000'.
        If the vNIC template has an associated QoS policy, the MTU specified here must be equal to or less than the MTU specified in the
        QoS system class.
        [Default: 1500]

= name
        The name of the vNIC template.
        This name can be between 1 and 16 alphanumeric characters.
        You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), "_" (underscore), : (colon), and . (period).
        You cannot change this name after the template is created.


- network_control_policy
        The network control policy that vNICs created from this vNIC template should use.
        [Default: (null)]

- org_dn
        Org dn (distinguished name)
        [Default: org-root]

= password
        Password for Cisco UCS Manager authentication.

        type: str

- peer_redundancy_template
        The Peer Redundancy Template.
        The name of the vNIC template sharing a configuration with this template.
        If the redundancy_type is primary, the name of the secondary template should be provided.
        If the redundancy_type is secondary, the name of the primary template should be provided.
        Secondary templates can only configure non-shared properties (name, description, and mac_pool).
        (Aliases: peer_redundancy_templ)[Default: (null)]

- pin_group
        The LAN pin group that vNICs created from this vNIC template should use.
        [Default: (null)]

- port
        Port number to be used during connection (by default uses 443 for https and 80 for http connection).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- proxy
        If use_proxy is no, specfies proxy to be used for connection. e.g. 'http://proxy.xy.z:8080'
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- qos_policy
        The quality of service (QoS) policy that vNICs created from this vNIC template should use.
        [Default: (null)]

- redundancy_type
        The Redundancy Type used for vNIC redundancy pairs during fabric failover.
        This can be one of the following:
        primary — Creates configurations that can be shared with the Secondary template.
        secondary — All shared configurations are inherited from the Primary template.
        none - Legacy vNIC template behavior. Select this option if you do not want to use redundancy.
        (Choices: none, primary, secondary)[Default: none]

- state
        If `present', will verify vNIC templates are present and will create if needed.
        If `absent', will verify vNIC templates are absent and will delete if needed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- stats_policy
        The statistics collection policy that vNICs created from this vNIC template should use.
        [Default: default]

- target
        The possible target for vNICs created from this template.
        The target determines whether or not Cisco UCS Manager automatically creates a VM-FEX port profile with the appropriate settings
        for the vNIC template.
        This can be one of the following:
        adapter — The vNICs apply to all adapters. No VM-FEX port profile is created if you choose this option.
        vm - The vNICs apply to all virtual machines. A VM-FEX port profile is created if you choose this option.
        [Default: adapter]

- template_type
        The Template Type field.
        This can be one of the following:
        initial-template — vNICs created from this template are not updated if the template changes.
        updating-template - vNICs created from this template are updated if the template changes.
        (Choices: initial-template, updating-template)[Default: initial-template]

- use_proxy
        If `no', will not use the proxy as defined by system environment variable.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- use_ssl
        If `no', an HTTP connection will be used instead of the default HTTPS connection.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- username
        Username for Cisco UCS Manager authentication.
        [Default: admin]
        type: str

- vlans_list
        List of VLANs used by the vNIC template.
        Each list element has the following suboptions:
        = name
          The name of the VLAN (required).
        - native
          Designates the VLAN as a native VLAN.  Only one VLAN in the list can be a native VLAN.
          [choices: 'no', 'yes']
          [Default: 'no']
        - state
          If present, will verify VLAN is present on template.
          If absent, will verify VLAN is absent on template.
          choices: [present, absent]
          default: present
        [Default: (null)]
