        Configure the E-Series management interfaces

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        The IPv4 address to assign to the interface.
        Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
        Mutually exclusive with `config_method=dhcp'
        [Default: (null)]

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- channel
        The port to modify the configuration for.
        The channel represents the port number (typically from left to right on the controller), beginning with a value of 1.
        Mutually exclusive with `name'.
        [Default: (null)]

- config_method
        The configuration method type to use for network interface ports.
        dhcp is mutually exclusive with `address', `subnet_mask', and `gateway'.
        (Choices: dhcp, static)[Default: (null)]

= controller
        The controller that owns the port you want to configure.
        Controller names are represented alphabetically, with the first controller as A, the second as B, and so on.
        Current hardware models have either 1 or 2 available controllers, but that is not a guaranteed hard limitation and could change
        in the future.
        (Choices: A, B)

- dns_address
        Primary IPv4 DNS server address
        [Default: (null)]

- dns_address_backup
        Backup IPv4 DNS server address
        Queried when primary DNS server fails
        [Default: (null)]

- dns_config_method
        The configuration method type to use for DNS services.
        dhcp is mutually exclusive with `dns_address', and `dns_address_backup'.
        (Choices: dhcp, static)[Default: (null)]

- gateway
        The IPv4 gateway address to utilize for the interface.
        Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
        Mutually exclusive with `config_method=dhcp'
        [Default: (null)]

- log_path
        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        The port to modify the configuration for.
        The list of choices is not necessarily comprehensive. It depends on the number of ports that are present in the system.
        The name represents the port number (typically from left to right on the controller), beginning with a value of 1.
        Mutually exclusive with `channel'.
        (Aliases: port, iface)[Default: (null)]

- ntp_address
        Primary IPv4 NTP server address
        [Default: (null)]

- ntp_address_backup
        Backup IPv4 NTP server address
        Queried when primary NTP server fails
        [Default: (null)]

- ntp_config_method
        The configuration method type to use for NTP services.
        disable is mutually exclusive with `ntp_address' and `ntp_address_backup'.
        dhcp is mutually exclusive with `ntp_address' and `ntp_address_backup'.
        (Choices: disable, dhcp, static)[Default: (null)]

- ssh
        Enable ssh access to the controller for debug purposes.
        This is a controller-level setting.
        rlogin/telnet will be enabled for ancient equipment where ssh is not available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- state
        Enable or disable IPv4 network interface configuration.
        Either IPv4 or IPv6 must be enabled otherwise error will occur.
        Only required when enabling or disabling IPv4 network interface
        (Aliases: enable_interface)(Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- subnet_mask
        The subnet mask to utilize for the interface.
        Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
        Mutually exclusive with `config_method=dhcp'
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * The interface settings are applied synchronously, but changes to the interface itself (receiving a new IP address via dhcp,
        etc), can take seconds or minutes longer to take effect.
      * Known issue: Changes specifically to down ports will result in a failure. However, this may not be the case in up coming
        NetApp E-Series firmware releases (released after firmware version 11.40.2).
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.

RETURN VALUES:

msg:
    description: Success message
    returned: on success
    type: str
    sample: The interface settings have been updated.
enabled:
    description:
        - Indicates whether IPv4 connectivity has been enabled or disabled.
        - This does not necessarily indicate connectivity. If dhcp was enabled absent a dhcp server, for instance,
          it is unlikely that the configuration will actually be valid.
    returned: on success
    sample: True
    type: bool
