> SLXOS_L3_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/slxos/slxos_l3_interface.py)

        This module provides declarative management of L3 interfaces on slxos network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of L3 interfaces definitions. Each of the entry in aggregate list should define name of interface `name' and a optional
        `ipv4' or `ipv6' address.
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv4
        IPv4 address to be set for the L3 interface mentioned in `name' option. The address format is <ipv4 address>/<mask>, the mask is
        number in range 0-32 eg. 192.168.0.1/24
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv6
        IPv6 address to be set for the L3 interface mentioned in `name' option. The address format is <ipv6 address>/<mask>, the mask is
        number in range 0-128 eg. fd5d:12c9:2201:1::1/64
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        Name of the L3 interface to be configured eg. Ethernet 0/2
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the L3 interface configuration. It indicates if the configuration should be present or absent on remote device.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * Tested against slxos 15.2
