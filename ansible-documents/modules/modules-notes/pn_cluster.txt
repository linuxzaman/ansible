> PN_CLUSTER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/netvisor/_pn_cluster.py)

        Execute cluster-create or cluster-delete command. A cluster allows two switches to cooperate in high-availability (HA)
        deployments. The nodes that form the cluster must be members of the same fabric. Clusters are typically used in conjunction with
        a virtual link aggregation group (VLAG) that allows links physically connected to two separate switches appear as a single trunk
        to a third device. The third device can be a switch,server, or any Ethernet device.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Doesn't support latest Pluribus Networks netvisor
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Latest modules will be pushed in Ansible future versions.
