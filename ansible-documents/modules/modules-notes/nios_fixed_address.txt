> NIOS_FIXED_ADDRESS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/net_tools/nios/nios_fixed_address.py)

        A fixed address is a specific IP address that a DHCP server always assigns when a lease request comes from a particular MAC
        address of the clien. Supports both IPV4 and IPV6 internet protocols
