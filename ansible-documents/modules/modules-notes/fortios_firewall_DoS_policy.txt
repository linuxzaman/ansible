> FORTIOS_FIREWALL_DOS_POLICY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_firewall_DoS_policy.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to configure firewall feature and DoS_policy
        category. Examples includes all options and need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2
