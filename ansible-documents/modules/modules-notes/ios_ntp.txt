        Manages core NTP configuration.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- acl
        ACL for peer/server access restricition.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth
        Enable NTP authentication. Data type boolean.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- auth_key
        md5 NTP authentication key of tye 7.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- key_id
        auth_key id. Datat type string
        [Default: (null)]

- logging
        Enable NTP logs. Data type boolean.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- provider
        *Deprecated*
