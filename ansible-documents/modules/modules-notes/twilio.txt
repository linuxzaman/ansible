> TWILIO    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/notification/twilio.py)

        Sends a text message to a phone number through the Twilio messaging API.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= account_sid
        user's Twilio account token found on the account page


= auth_token
        user's Twilio authentication token


= from_number
        the Twilio number to send the text message from, format +15551112222


- media_url
        a URL with a picture, video or sound clip to send with an MMS (multimedia message) instead of a plain SMS
        [Default: (null)]

= msg
        the body of the text message


= to_numbers
        one or more phone numbers to send the text message to, format +15551112222
        (Aliases: to_number)


NOTES:
      * This module is non-idempotent because it sends an email through the external API. It is idempotent only in the case that
        the module fails.
      * Like the other notification modules, this one requires an external dependency to work. In this case, you'll need a Twilio
        account with a purchased or verified phone number to send the text message.
