> BIGIP_LX_PACKAGE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_lx_package.py)

        Manages Javascript LX packages on a BIG-IP. This module will allow you to deploy LX packages to the BIG-IP and manage their
        lifecycle.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- package
        The LX package that you want to upload or remove. When `state' is `present', and you intend to use this module in a `role', it is
        recommended that you use the `{{ role_path }}' variable. An example is provided in the `EXAMPLES' section.
        When `state' is `absent', it is not necessary for the package to exist on the Ansible controller. If the full path to the package
        is provided, the fileame will specifically be cherry picked from it to properly remove the package.

NOTES:
      * Requires the rpm tool be installed on the host. This can be accomplished through different ways on each platform. On Debian
        based systems with `apt'; `apt-get install rpm'. On Mac with `brew'; `brew install rpm'. This command is already present on
        RedHat based systems.
      * Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.0 because the required functionality is missing on versions earlier than that.
      * The module name `bigip_iapplx_package' has been deprecated in favor of `bigip_lx_package'.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.


REQUIREMENTS:  Requires BIG-IP >= 12.1.0, The 'rpm' tool installed on the Ansible controller
