> FORTIOS_IPV4_POLICY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_ipv4_policy.py)

        [Default: (null)]

- av_profile
        Specifies Antivirus profile name.
        [Default: (null)]

- backup
        This argument will cause the module to create a backup of the current `running-config' from the remote device before any changes
        are made.  The backup file is written to the i(backup) folder.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- backup_filename
        Specifies the backup filename. If omitted filename will be formatted like HOST_config.YYYY-MM-DD@HH:MM:SS
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- backup_path
        Specifies where to store backup files. Required if `backup=yes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- comment
        free text to describe policy.
        [Default: (null)]

- config_file
        Path to configuration file. Required when `file_mode' is True.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path
        version_added: 2.4

- dst_addr
        Specifies destination address (or group) object name(s). Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

- dst_addr_negate
        Negate destination address param.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- dst_intf
        Specifies destination interface name(s).
        [Default: any]

- file_mode
        Don't connect to any device, only use `config_file' as input and Output.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- fixedport
        Use fixed port for nat.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

        Specifies the DNS hostname or IP address for connecting to the remote fortios device. Required when `file_mode' is False.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= id
        Policy ID. Warning: policy ID number is different than Policy sequence number. The policy ID is the number assigned at policy
        creation. The sequence number represents the order in which the Fortigate will evaluate the rule for policy enforcement, and also
        the order in which rules are listed in the GUI and CLI. These two numbers do not necessarily correlate: this module is based off
        policy ID. TIP: policy ID can be viewed in the GUI by adding 'ID' to the display columns

        version_added: 2.4

- nat
        Enable or disable Nat.
