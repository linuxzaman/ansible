        Installs Python libraries, optionally in a `virtualenv'

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- executable
        The explicit executable or a pathname to the executable to be used to run easy_install for a specific version of Python installed
        in the system. For example `easy_install-3.3', if there are both Python 2.7 and 3.3 installations in the system and you want to
        run easy_install for the Python 3.3 installation.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.3

= name
        A Python library name


- state
        The desired state of the library. `latest' ensures that the latest version is installed.
        (Choices: present, latest)[Default: present]
        version_added: 2.0

- virtualenv
        an optional `virtualenv' directory path to install into. If the `virtualenv' does not exist, it is created automatically
        [Default: (null)]

- virtualenv_command
        The command to create the virtual environment with. For example `pyvenv', `virtualenv', `virtualenv2'.
        [Default: virtualenv]
        version_added: 1.1

- virtualenv_site_packages
        Whether the virtual environment will inherit packages from the global site-packages directory.  Note that if this setting is
        changed on an already existing virtual environment it will not have any effect, the environment must be deleted and newly
        created.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.1


NOTES:
      * Please note that the `easy_install' module can only install Python libraries. Thus this module is not able to remove
        libraries. It is generally recommended to use the [pip] module which you can first install using [easy_install].
      * Also note that `virtualenv' must be installed on the remote host if the `virtualenv' parameter is specified.
