EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

- name: Create(if not exists) and assign affinity group to VMs vm1 and vm2 and host host1
  ovirt_affinity_group:
    name: mygroup
    cluster: mycluster
    vm_enforcing: true
    vm_rule: positive
    host_enforcing: true
    host_rule: positive
    vms:
      - vm1
      - vm2
    hosts:
      - host1

- name: Detach VMs from affinity group and disable VM rule
  ovirt_affinity_group:
    name: mygroup
    cluster: mycluster
    vm_enforcing: false
    vm_rule: disabled
    host_enforcing: true
    host_rule: positive
    vms: []
    hosts:
      - host1
      - host2

- name: Remove affinity group
  ovirt_affinity_group:
    state: absent
    cluster: mycluster
    name: mygroup
