  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- ignore_down_response
        Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
        When `yes', specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout
        is reached without the system receiving an up response, the system marks the object down.
        When `no', specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it receives a down response.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- interval
        Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check when either the resource is down or the status
        of the resource is unknown.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `30'. This value *must* be less
        than the `timeout' value.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value
        will be '*'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        Monitor name.

        type: str

- parent
        The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the
        `tcp_half_open' parent on the `Common' partition.
        [Default: /Common/tcp_half_open]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- port
        Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- probe_attempts
        Specifies the number of times the system attempts to probe the host server, after which the system considers the host server down
        or unavailable.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `3'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- probe_interval
        Specifies the number of seconds the big3d process waits before sending out a subsequent probe attempt when a probe fails and
        multiple probe attempts have been requested.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `1'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- probe_timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds after which the system times out the probe request to the system.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `5'.
        [Default: (null)]

- timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request.
        If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up.
        If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down.

        A monitor in transparent mode directs traffic through the associated pool members or nodes (usually a router or firewall) to the
        aliased destination (that is, it probes the `ip'-`port' combination specified in the monitor).

        sent is marked down.

NOTES:
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
