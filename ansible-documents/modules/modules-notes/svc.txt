OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- downed
        Should a 'down' file exist or not, if it exists it disables auto startup. Defaults to no. Downed does not imply stopped.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- enabled
        Whether the service is enabled or not, if disabled it also implies stopped. Take note that a service can be enabled and downed
        (no auto restart).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        Name of the service to manage.

        type: str

- service_dir
        Directory svscan watches for services
        [Default: /service]
        type: str

- service_src
        Directory where services are defined, the source of symlinks to service_dir.
        [Default: /etc/service]
        type: str

- state
        `Started'/`stopped' are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.  `restarted' will always bounce the svc
        (svc -t) and `killed' will always bounce the svc (svc -k). `reloaded' will send a sigusr1 (svc -1). `once' will run a normally
        downed svc once (svc -o), not really an idempotent operation.
        (Choices: killed, once, reloaded, restarted, started, stopped)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
