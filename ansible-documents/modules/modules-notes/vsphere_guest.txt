> VSPHERE_GUEST    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/vmware/_vsphere_guest.py)

        Create/delete/reconfigure a guest VM through VMware vSphere. This module has a dependency on pysphere >= 1.7

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Replaced by M(vmware_guest) module. Also, 'Pysphere' is deprecated in favor of VMware's Official Python bindings - 'Pyvmomi'.
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.9
	Alternatives: Use M(vmware_guest) and other vmware guest related modules instead.


  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- cluster
        The name of the cluster to create the VM in. By default this is derived from the host you tell the module to build the guest on.
        [Default: (null)]

- esxi
        Dictionary which includes datacenter and hostname on which the VM should be created. For standalone ESXi hosts, ha-datacenter
        should be used as the datacenter name
        [Default: (null)]

- force
        Boolean. Allows you to run commands which may alter the running state of a guest. Also used to reconfigure and destroy.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- from_template
        Specifies if the VM should be deployed from a template (mutually exclusive with 'state' parameter). No guest customization
        changes to hardware such as CPU, RAM, NICs or Disks can be applied when launching from template.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.9

= guest
        The virtual server name you wish to manage.


= password
        Password of the user to connect to vcenter as.


- power_on_after_clone
        Specifies if the VM should be powered on after the clone.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- resource_pool
        The name of the resource_pool to create the VM in.
        [Default: (null)]

- snapshot_to_clone
        A string that when specified, will create a linked clone copy of the VM. Snapshot must already be taken in vCenter.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.0

- state
        Indicate desired state of the vm. 'reconfigured' only applies changes to 'vm_cdrom', 'memory_mb', and 'num_cpus' in vm_hardware
        parameter. The 'memory_mb' and 'num_cpus' changes are applied to powered-on vms when hot-plugging is enabled for the guest.
        (Choices: present, powered_off, absent, powered_on, restarted, reconfigured, reboot_guest, poweroff_guest)[Default: present]

- template_src
        Name of the source template to deploy from
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.9

= username
        Username to connect to vcenter as.


- validate_certs
        Validate SSL certs.  Note, if running on python without SSLContext support (typically, python < 2.7.9) you will have to set this
        to `no' as pysphere does not support validating certificates on older python. Prior to 2.1, this module would always validate on
        python >= 2.7.9 and never validate on python <= 2.7.8.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.1
        

= vcenter_hostname
        The hostname of the vcenter server the module will connect to, to create the guest.


- vm_disk
        A key, value list of disks and their sizes and which datastore to keep it in.
        [Default: (null)]

- vm_extra_config
        A key, value pair of any extra values you want set or changed in the vmx file of the VM. Useful to set advanced options on the
        VM.
        [Default: (null)]

- vm_hardware
        A key, value list of VM config settings. Must include ['memory_mb', 'num_cpus', 'osid', 'scsi'].
        [Default: (null)]

- vm_hw_version
        Desired hardware version identifier (for example, "vmx-08" for vms that needs to be managed with vSphere Client). Note that
        changing hardware version of existing vm is not supported.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.7

- vm_nic
        A key, value list of nics, their types and what network to put them on.
        Optionaly with their MAC address.
        [Default: (null)]

- vmware_guest_facts
        Gather facts from vCenter on a particular VM
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * This module should run from a system that can access vSphere directly. Either by using local_action, or using delegate_to.


REQUIREMENTS:  python >= 2.6, pysphere

# Options ['state', 'vm_extra_config', 'vm_disk', 'vm_nic', 'vm_hardware', 'esxi'] are required together
