> BIGIP_REMOTE_ROLE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_remote_role.py)

        Manages remote roles on a BIG-IP. Remote roles are used in situations where user authentication is handled off-box. Local access
        control to the BIG-IP is controlled by the defined remote role. Where-as authentication (and by extension, assignment to the
        role) is handled off-box.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- assigned_role
        Specifies the authorization (level of access) for the account.
        When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not provided, the default is `none'.
        The `partition_access' parameter controls which partitions the account can access.
        The chosen role may affect the partitions that one is allowed to specify. Specifically, roles such as `administrator', `auditor'
        and `resource-administrator' required a `partition_access' of `all'.
        A set of pre-existing roles ship with the system. They are `none', `guest', `operator', `application-editor', `manager',
        `certificate-manager', `irule-manager', `user-manager', `resource-administrator', `auditor', `administrator', `firewall-manager'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- attribute_string
        Specifies the user account attributes saved in the group, in the format `cn=, ou=, dc='.
        When creating a new remote role, this parameter is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- line_order
        Specifies the order of the line in the file `/config/bigip/auth/remoterole'.
        The LDAP and Active Directory servers read this file line by line.
        The order of the information is important; therefore, F5 recommends that you set the first line at 1000. This allows you, in the
        future, to insert lines before the first line.
        When creating a new remote role, this parameter is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= name
        Specifies the name of the remote role.

        type: str

- partition_access
        Specifies the accessible partitions for the account.
        This parameter supports the reserved names `all' and `Common', as well as specific partitions a user may access.
        Users who have access to a partition can operate on objects in that partition, as determined by the permissions conferred by the
        user's `assigned_role'.
        When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `all'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= password
        The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.

          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This argument is only used for `cli' transports.

          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
