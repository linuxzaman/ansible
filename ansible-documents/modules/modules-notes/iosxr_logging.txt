        This module provides declarative management configuration of system logging (syslog) on Cisco IOS XR devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of syslog logging configuration definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- dest
        Destination for system logging (syslog) messages.
        (Choices: host, console, monitor, buffered, file)[Default: (null)]

- facility
        To configure the type of syslog facility in which system logging (syslog) messages are sent to syslog servers Optional config for
        `dest' = `host'
        [Default: local7]

- hostnameprefix
        To append a hostname prefix to system logging (syslog) messages logged to syslog servers. Optional config for `dest' = `host'
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.5
        

- level
        Specifies the severity level for the logging.
        (Aliases: severity)[Default: debugging]

- name
        When `dest' = `file' name indicates file-name
        When `dest' = `host' name indicates the host-name or ip-address of syslog server.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(Network Guide, ../network/getting_started/network_differences.html#multiple-communication-
        protocols).
        HORIZONTALLINE

        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over

            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:

            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict

- size
        Size of buffer when `dest' = `buffered'. The acceptable value is in the range `307200 to 125000000 bytes'. Default 307200
        Size of file when `dest' = `file'. The acceptable value is in the range `1 to 2097152'KB. Default 2 GB
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Existential state of the logging configuration on the node.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- vrf
