> BIGIP_POLICY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_policy.py)

        Manages general policy configuration on a BIG-IP. This module is best used in conjunction with the `bigip_policy_rule' module.
        This module can handle general configuration like setting the draft state of the policy, the description, and things unrelated to
        the policy rules themselves. It is also the first module that should be used when creating rules as the `bigip_policy_rule'
        module requires a policy parameter.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- description

        type: dict
        version_added: 2.5

- rules
        Specifies a list of rules that you want associated with this policy. The order of this list is the order they will be evaluated
        by BIG-IP. If the specified rules do not exist (for example when creating a new policy) then they will be created.
        The `conditions' for a default rule are `all'.
        The `actions' for a default rule are `ignore'.
        The `bigip_policy_rule' module can be used to create and edit existing and new rules.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- state
        When `state' is `present', ensures that the policy exists and is published. When `state' is `absent', ensures that the policy is
        removed, even if it is currently drafted.
        When `state' is `draft', ensures that the policy exists and is drafted. When modifying rules, it is required that policies first
        be in a draft.
        Drafting is only supported on versions of BIG-IP >= 12.1.0. On versions prior to that, specifying a `state' of `draft' will raise
        an error.
        (Choices: present, absent, draft)[Default: present]
        type: str

- strategy
        Specifies the method to determine which actions get executed in the case where there are multiple rules that match. When creating
        new policies, the default is `first'.
        This module does not allow you to specify the `best' strategy to use. It will choose the system default (`/Common/best-match')
        for you instead.
        (Choices: first, all, best)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

= user
        The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
