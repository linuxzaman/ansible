        Configures IP address pools and blocks of IP addresses on Cisco UCS Manager. Examples can be used with the UCS Platform Emulator

= hostname
        IP address or hostname of Cisco UCS Manager.

        [Default: ::]

- ipv6_first_addr
        The first IPv6 address in the IPv6 addresses block.
        This is the From field in the UCS Manager Add IPv6 Blocks menu.
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv6_last_addr
        The last IPv6 address in the IPv6 addresses block.
        This is the To field in the UCS Manager Add IPv6 Blocks menu.
        [Default: (null)]

- ipv6_prefix
        The network address prefix associated with the IPv6 addresses in the block.
        [Default: 64]

- ipv6_primary_dns
        The primary DNS server that this block of IPv6 addresses should access.
        [Default: ::]

- ipv6_secondary_dns
        The secondary DNS server that this block of IPv6 addresses should access.
        [Default: ::]

- last_addr
        The last IPv4 address in the IPv4 addresses block.
        This is the To field in the UCS Manager Add IPv4 Blocks menu.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        The name of the IP address pool.
        This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters.
        You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), "_" (underscore), : (colon), and . (period).
        You cannot change this name after the IP address pool is created.


- order
        The Assignment Order field.
        This can be one of the following:
        default - Cisco UCS Manager selects a random identity from the pool.
        sequential - Cisco UCS Manager selects the lowest available identity from the pool.
        (Choices: default, sequential)[Default: default]

- org_dn
        Org dn (distinguished name)
        [Default: org-root]

= password
        Password for Cisco UCS Manager authentication.

        type: str

- port
        Port number to be used during connection (by default uses 443 for https and 80 for http connection).
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- primary_dns
        The primary DNS server that this block of IPv4 addresses should access.
        [Default: 0.0.0.0]

- proxy
        If use_proxy is no, specfies proxy to be used for connection. e.g. 'http://proxy.xy.z:8080'
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- secondary_dns
        The secondary DNS server that this block of IPv4 addresses should access.
        [Default: 0.0.0.0]

- state
        If `present', will verify IP pool is present and will create if needed.
        If `absent', will verify IP pool is absent and will delete if needed.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subnet_mask
        The subnet mask associated with the IPv4 addresses in the block.
        [Default: 255.255.255.0]

- use_proxy
        If `no', will not use the proxy as defined by system environment variable.
        [Default: True]
