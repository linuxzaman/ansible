EXAMPLES:

# Create 'burgers' database user with name 'bob' and password '12345'.
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: bob
    password: 12345
    state: present

# Create a database user via SSL (MongoDB must be compiled with the SSL option and configured properly)
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: bob
    password: 12345
    state: present
    ssl: True

# Delete 'burgers' database user with name 'bob'.
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: bob
    state: absent

# Define more users with various specific roles (if not defined, no roles is assigned, and the user will be added via pre mongo 2.2 style)
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: ben
    password: 12345
    roles: read
    state: present
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: jim
    password: 12345
    roles: readWrite,dbAdmin,userAdmin
    state: present
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: joe
    password: 12345
    roles: readWriteAnyDatabase
    state: present

# add a user to database in a replica set, the primary server is automatically discovered and written to
- mongodb_user:
    database: burgers
    name: bob
    replica_set: belcher
    password: 12345
    roles: readWriteAnyDatabase
    state: present

# add a user 'oplog_reader' with read only access to the 'local' database on the replica_set 'belcher'. This is useful for oplog access (MONGO_OPLOG_URL).
# please notice the credentials must be added to the 'admin' database because the 'local' database is not syncronized and can't receive user credentials
# To login with such user, the connection string should be MONGO_OPLOG_URL="mongodb://oplog_reader:oplog_reader_password@server1,server2/local?authSource=admin"
# This syntax requires mongodb 2.6+ and pymongo 2.5+
- mongodb_user:
    login_user: root
    login_password: root_password
    database: admin
    user: oplog_reader
    password: oplog_reader_password
    state: present
    replica_set: belcher
