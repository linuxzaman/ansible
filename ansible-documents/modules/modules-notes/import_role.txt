> IMPORT_ROLE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/utilities/logic/import_role.py)

        Much like the `roles:' keyword, this task loads a role, but it allows you to control it when the role tasks run in between other
        tasks of the play. Most keywords, loops and conditionals will only be applied to the imported tasks, not to this statement
        itself. If you want the opposite behavior, use [include_role] instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- allow_duplicates
        Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- defaults_from
        File to load from a role's `defaults/' directory.
        [Default: main]
        type: str

- handlers_from
        File to load from a role's `handlers/' directory.
        [Default: main]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.8

= name
        The name of the role to be executed.

        type: str

- tasks_from
        File to load from a role's `tasks/' directory.
        [Default: main]
        type: str

- vars_from
        File to load from a role's `vars/' directory.
        [Default: main]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * Handlers are made available to the whole play.
      * Since Ansible 2.7 variables defined in `vars' and `defaults' for the role are exposed at playbook parsing time. Due to
        this, these variables will be accessible to roles and tasks executed before the location of the [import_role] task.
      * Unlike [include_role] variable exposure is not configurable, and will always be exposed.
