        Manages the AFM port lists on a BIG-IP. This module can be used to add and remove port list entries.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- description
        Description of the port list
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name

        type: str

- port_lists
        Simple list of existing port lists to add to this list. Port lists can be specified in either their fully qualified name
        (/Common/foo) or their short name (foo). If a short name is used, the `partition' argument will automatically be prepended to the
        short name.

        type: list

- port_ranges
        A list of port ranges where the range starts with a port number, is followed by a dash (-) and then a second number.
        If the first number is greater than the second number, the numbers will be reversed so-as to be properly formatted. ie, 90-78
        would become 78-90.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
