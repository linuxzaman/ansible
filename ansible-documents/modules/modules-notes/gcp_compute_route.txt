> GCP_COMPUTE_ROUTE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gcp_compute_route.py)

        Represents a Route resource. A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by the virtual network.
        Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag, and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its routing
        table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best
        matching route. Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If
        there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three
        and four packet headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by the
        next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
        Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped. A
        Route resource must have exactly one specification of either nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, or nextHopVpnTunnel.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- description
        An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7
        

= dest_range
        The destination range of outgoing packets that this route applies to.
        Only IPv4 is supported.


= name
        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
        means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
        except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


= network
        The network that this route applies to.
        This field represents a link to a Network resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_network task and then set this network field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"


- next_hop_gateway
        URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets.
        Currently, you can only specify the internet gateway, using a full or partial valid URL: *
        https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway *
        projects/project/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway * global/gateways/default-internet-gateway .
        [Default: (null)]

- next_hop_instance
        URL to an instance that should handle matching packets.
        You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example: * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/
        instances/instance * projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance * zones/zone/instances/instance .
        This field represents a link to a Instance resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_instance task and then set this next_hop_instance field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
        [Default: (null)]

- next_hop_ip
        Network IP address of an instance that should handle matching packets.
        [Default: (null)]

- next_hop_vpn_tunnel
        URL to a VpnTunnel that should handle matching packets.
        This field represents a link to a VpnTunnel resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary
        with key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_vpn_tunnel task and then set this next_hop_vpn_tunnel field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"
        [Default: (null)]

- priority
        The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases where there is more than one matching route of equal prefix
        length.
        In the case of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the lowest-numbered priority value wins.
        Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through 65535.
        [Default: (null)]

- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- tags
        A list of instance tags to which this route applies.
        [Default: (null)]
