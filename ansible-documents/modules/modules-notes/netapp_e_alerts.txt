> NETAPP_E_ALERTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/storage/netapp/netapp_e_alerts.py)

        Certain E-Series systems have the capability to send email notifications on potentially critical events. This module will allow
        the owner of the system to specify email recipients for these messages.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- contact
        Allows the owner to specify some free-form contact information to be included in the emails.
        This is typically utilized to provide a contact phone number.
        [Default: (null)]

- log_path
        Path to a file on the Ansible control node to be used for debug logging
        [Default: (null)]

- recipients
        The email addresses that will receive the email notifications.
        Required when `state=enabled'.
        [Default: (null)]

- sender
        This is the sender that the recipient will see. It doesn't necessarily need to be a valid email account.
        Required when `state=enabled'.
        [Default: (null)]

- server
        A fully qualified domain name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address of a mail server.
        To use a fully qualified domain name, you must configure a DNS server on both controllers using [netapp_e_mgmt_interface]. -
        Required when `state=enabled'.
        [Default: (null)]

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- state
        Enable/disable the sending of email-based alerts.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: enabled]

- test
        When a change is detected in the configuration, a test email will be sent.
        This may take a few minutes to process.
        Only applicable if `state=enabled'.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?

        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * Alertable messages are a subset of messages shown by the Major Event Log (MEL), of the storage-system. Examples of
        alertable messages include drive failures, failed controllers, loss of redundancy, and other warning/critical events.
      * This API is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v2.0 and higher.
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
