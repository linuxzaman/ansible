> WIN_DNS_CLIENT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_dns_client.py)

        The `win_dns_client' module configures the DNS client on Windows network adapters.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= adapter_names
        Adapter name or list of adapter names for which to manage DNS settings ('*' is supported as a wildcard value).
        The adapter name used is the connection caption in the Network Control Panel or via `Get-NetAdapter', eg `Local Area Connection'.

        type: str

= ipv4_addresses
        Single or ordered list of DNS server IPv4 addresses to configure for lookup. An empty list will configure the adapter to use the
        DHCP-assigned values on connections where DHCP is enabled, or disable DNS lookup on statically-configured connections.

        type: str


NOTES:
      * When setting an empty list of DNS server addresses on an adapter with DHCP enabled, a change will always be registered,
        since it is not possible to detect the difference between a DHCP-sourced server value and one that is statically set.
