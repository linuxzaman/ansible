> SVR4PKG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/packaging/os/svr4pkg.py)

        Manages SVR4 packages on Solaris 10 and 11. These were the native packages on Solaris <= 10 and are available as a legacy feature
        in Solaris 11. Note that this is a very basic packaging system. It will not enforce dependencies on install or remove.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- category
        Install/Remove category instead of a single package.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.6

= name
        Package name, e.g. `SUNWcsr'


- proxy
        HTTP[s] proxy to be used if `src' is a URL.
        [Default: (null)]

- response_file
        Specifies the location of a response file to be used if package expects input on install. (added in Ansible 1.4)
        [Default: (null)]

- src
        Specifies the location to install the package from. Required when `state=present'.
        Can be any path acceptable to the `pkgadd' command's `-d' option. e.g.: `somefile.pkg', `/dir/with/pkgs',
        `http:/server/mypkgs.pkg'.
        If using a file or directory, they must already be accessible by the host. See the [copy] module for a way to get them there.
        [Default: (null)]

= state
        Whether to install (`present'), or remove (`absent') a package.
        If the package is to be installed, then `src' is required.
        The SVR4 package system doesn't provide an upgrade operation. You need to uninstall the old, then install the new package.
        (Choices: present, absent)

- zone
        Whether to install the package only in the current zone, or install it into all zones.
        The installation into all zones works only if you are working with the global zone.
        (Choices: current, all)[Default: all]
        version_added: 1.6
