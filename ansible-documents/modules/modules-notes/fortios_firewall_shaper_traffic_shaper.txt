> FORTIOS_FIREWALL_SHAPER_TRAFFIC_SHAPER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_firewall_shaper_traffic_shaper.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to configure firewall_shaper feature and
        traffic_shaper category. Examples includes all options and need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS
        v6.0.2

          guaranteed-bandwidth:
            description:
            - Amount of bandwidth guaranteed for this shaper (0 - 16776000). Units depend
              on the bandwidth-unit setting.
          maximum-bandwidth:
            description:
            - Upper bandwidth limit enforced by this shaper (0 - 16776000). 0 means no limit.

              compromising the guaranteed bandwidth.
          state:
            choices:
            - present
