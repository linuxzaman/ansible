> GCE_LABELS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gce_labels.py)

        Create, Update or Destroy GCE Labels on instances, disks, snapshots, etc. When specifying the GCE resource, users may specifiy
        the full URL for the resource (its 'self_link'), or the individual parameters of the resource (type, location, name). Examples
        for the two options can be seen in the documentaion. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/label-or-tag-resources for more
        information about GCE Labels. Labels are gradually being added to more GCE resources, so this module will need to be updated as
        new resources are added to the GCE (v1) API.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- labels
        A list of labels (key/value pairs) to add or remove for the resource.
        [Default: (null)]

- resource_location
        The location of resource (global, us-central1-f, etc.)
        [Default: (null)]

- resource_name
        The name of resource.
        [Default: (null)]

- resource_type
        The type of resource (instances, disks, snapshots, images)
        [Default: (null)]

- resource_url
        The 'self_link' for the resource (instance, disk, snapshot, etc)
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Labels support resources such as  instances, disks, images, etc. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-
        resources for the list of resources available in the GCE v1 API (not alpha or beta).
