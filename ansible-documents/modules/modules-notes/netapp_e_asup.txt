OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

        Enable active/proactive monitoring for ASUP. When a problem is detected by our monitoring systems, it's possible that the bundle
        did not contain all of the required information at the time of the event. Enabling this option allows NetApp support personnel to
        manually request transmission or re-transmission of support data in order ot resolve the problem.
        Only applicable if `state=enabled'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.

- end
        An end hour may be specified in a range from 1 to 24 hours.
        ASUP bundles will be sent daily between the provided start and end time (UTC).
        `start' must be less than `end'.
        (Aliases: end_time)[Default: 24]

- log_path
        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Enable/disable the E-Series auto-support configuration.
        When this option is enabled, configuration, logs, and other support-related information will be relayed to NetApp to help better
        support your system. No personally identifiable information, passwords, etc, will be collected.

        [Default: False]

NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * Enabling ASUP will allow our support teams to monitor the logs of the storage-system in order to proactively respond to
        issues with the system. It is recommended that all ASUP-related options be enabled, but they may be disabled if desired.
      * This API is currently only supported with the Embedded Web Services API v2.0 and higher.
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.
