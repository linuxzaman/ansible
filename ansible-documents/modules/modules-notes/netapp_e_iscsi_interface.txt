        Configure settings of an E-Series iSCSI interface

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        The IPv4 address to assign to the interface.
        Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
        Mutually exclusive with `config_method=dhcp'
        [Default: (null)]

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API. Example https://prod-1.wahoo.acme.com/devmgr/v2


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity Web Services Proxy or Embedded Web Services API.


- config_method
        The configuration method type to use for this interface.
        dhcp is mutually exclusive with `address', `subnet_mask', and `gateway'.
        (Choices: dhcp, static)[Default: dhcp]

= controller
        The controller that owns the port you want to configure.
        Controller names are presented alphabetically, with the first controller as A, the second as B, and so on.
        Current hardware models have either 1 or 2 available controllers, but that is not a guaranteed hard limitation and could change
        in the future.
        (Choices: A, B)

- gateway
        The IPv4 gateway address to utilize for the interface.
        Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
        Mutually exclusive with `config_method=dhcp'
        [Default: (null)]

- log_path
        A local path to a file to be used for debug logging
        [Default: (null)]

- mtu
        The maximum transmission units (MTU), in bytes.
        This allows you to configure a larger value for the MTU, in order to enable jumbo frames (any value > 1500).
        Generally, it is necessary to have your host, switches, and other components not only support jumbo frames, but also have it
        configured properly. Therefore, unless you know what you're doing, it's best to leave this at the default.
        (Aliases: max_frame_size)[Default: 1500]

= name
        The channel of the port to modify the configuration of.
        The list of choices is not necessarily comprehensive. It depends on the number of ports that are available in the system.
        The numerical value represents the number of the channel (typically from left to right on the HIC), beginning with a value of 1.
        (Aliases: channel)

- ssid
        The ID of the array to manage. This value must be unique for each array.
        [Default: 1]

- state
        When enabled, the provided configuration will be utilized.
        When disabled, the IPv4 configuration will be cleared and IPv4 connectivity disabled.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: enabled]

- subnet_mask
        The subnet mask to utilize for the interface.
        Should be specified in xx.xx.xx.xx form.
        Mutually exclusive with `config_method=dhcp'
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        Should https certificates be validated?
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Check mode is supported.
      * The interface settings are applied synchronously, but changes to the interface itself (receiving a new IP address via dhcp,
        etc), can take seconds or minutes longer to take effect.
      * This module will not be useful/usable on an E-Series system without any iSCSI interfaces.
      * This module requires a Web Services API version of >= 1.3.
      * The E-Series Ansible modules require either an instance of the Web Services Proxy (WSP), to be available to manage the
        storage-system, or an E-Series storage-system that supports the Embedded Web Services API.
      * Embedded Web Services is currently available on the E2800, E5700, EF570, and newer hardware models.
      * [netapp_e_storage_system] may be utilized for configuring the systems managed by a WSP instance.

RETURN VALUES:

    description: Success message
    returned: on success
    type: str
    sample: The interface settings have been updated.
enabled:
    description:
        - Indicates whether IPv4 connectivity has been enabled or disabled.
        - This does not necessarily indicate connectivity. If dhcp was enabled without a dhcp server, for instance,
          it is unlikely that the configuration will actually be valid.
    returned: on success
    sample: True
    type: bool
