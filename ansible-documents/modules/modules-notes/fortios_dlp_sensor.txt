> FORTIOS_DLP_SENSOR    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_dlp_sensor.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to configure dlp feature and sensor category.
        Examples includes all options and need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2
