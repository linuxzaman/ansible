OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth
        Dictionary with values needed to create HTTP/HTTPS connection to oVirt:
        `username'[`required'] - The name of the user, something like `admin@internal'. Default value is set by `OVIRT_USERNAME'
        environment variable.
        `password'[`required'] - The password of the user. Default value is set by `OVIRT_PASSWORD' environment variable.
        `url'- A string containing the API URL of the server, usually something like ``https://server.example.com/ovirt-engine/api'`.
        Default value is set by `OVIRT_URL' environment variable. Either `url' or `hostname' is required.
        `hostname' - A string containing the hostname of the server, usually something like ``server.example.com'`. Default value is set
        by `OVIRT_HOSTNAME' environment variable. Either `url' or `hostname' is required.
        `token' - Token to be used instead of login with username/password. Default value is set by `OVIRT_TOKEN' environment variable.
        `insecure' - A boolean flag that indicates if the server TLS certificate and host name should be checked.
        `ca_file' - A PEM file containing the trusted CA certificates. The certificate presented by the server will be verified using
        these CA certificates. If ``ca_file'` parameter is not set, system wide CA certificate store is used. Default value is set by
        `OVIRT_CAFILE' environment variable.
        `kerberos' - A boolean flag indicating if Kerberos authentication should be used instead of the default basic authentication.
        `headers' - Dictionary of HTTP headers to be added to each API call.

        type: dict

- case_sensitive
        Indicates if the search performed using the search parameter should be performed taking case into account. The default value is
        true, which means that case is taken into account. If you want to search ignoring case set it to false.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- fetch_nested
        If `yes' the module will fetch additional data from the API.
        It will fetch IDs of the VMs disks, snapshots, etc. User can configure to fetch other attributes of the nested entities by
        specifying `nested_attributes'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.3

- from_
        Indicates the event index after which events should be returned. The indexes of events are strictly increasing, so when this
        parameter is used only the events with greater indexes will be returned.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- headers
        Additional HTTP headers.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- max
        Sets the maximum number of events to return. If not specified all the events are returned.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- nested_attributes
        Specifies list of the attributes which should be fetched from the API.
        This parameter apply only when `fetch_nested' is `true'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.3

- query
        Additional URL query parameters.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- search
        Search term which is accepted by the oVirt/RHV API.
        For example to search for events of severity alert use the following pattern: severity=alert
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- wait
        If True wait for the response.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

# Examples don't contain the auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at the ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication.

  ovirt_event_facts:

- name: Return the last 10 events
