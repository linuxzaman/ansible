> BIGIP_DNS_NAMESERVER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_dns_nameserver.py)

        Manages LTM DNS nameservers on a BIG-IP. These nameservers form part of what is known as DNS Express on a BIG-IP. This module
        does not configure GTM related functionality, nor does it configure system-level name servers that affect the base system's
        ability to resolve DNS names.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
