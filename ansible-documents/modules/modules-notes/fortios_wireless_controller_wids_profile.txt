> FORTIOS_WIRELESS_CONTROLLER_WIDS_PROFILE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_wireless_controller_wids_profile.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify wireless_controller feature and
        wids_profile category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with
        FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= host
        FortiOS or FortiGate ip address.
