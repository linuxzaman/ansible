        Publish a message on an MQTT topic.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- ca_cert
        The path to the Certificate Authority certificate files that are to be treated as trusted by this client. If this is the only
        option given then the client will operate in a similar manner to a web browser. That is to say it will require the broker to have
        a certificate signed by the Certificate Authorities in ca_certs and will communicate using TLS v1, but will not attempt any form
        of authentication. This provides basic network encryption but may not be sufficient depending on how the broker is configured.
        (Aliases: ca_certs)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3
        

- client_cert
        The path pointing to the PEM encoded client certificate. If this is not None it will be used as client information for TLS based
        authentication. Support for this feature is broker dependent.
        (Aliases: certfile)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3
        

- client_id
        MQTT client identifier
        [Default: hostname + pid]

- client_key
        The path pointing to the PEM encoded client private key. If this is not None it will be used as client information for TLS based
        authentication. Support for this feature is broker dependent.
        (Aliases: keyfile)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3
        

- password
        Password for `username' to authenticate against the broker.
        [Default: (null)]

= payload
        Payload. The special string `"None"' may be used to send a NULL (i.e. empty) payload which is useful to simply notify with the
        `topic' or to clear previously retained messages.


- port
        MQTT broker port number
        [Default: 1883]

- qos
        QoS (Quality of Service)
        (Choices: 0, 1, 2)[Default: 0]

- retain
        Setting this flag causes the broker to retain (i.e. keep) the message so that applications that subsequently subscribe to the
        topic can received the last retained message immediately.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- server
        MQTT broker address/name
        [Default: localhost]

= topic
        MQTT topic name


- username
        Username to authenticate against the broker.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * This module requires a connection to an MQTT broker such as Mosquitto http://mosquitto.org and the `Paho' `mqtt' Python
        client (https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/).
