> ISO_EXTRACT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/files/iso_extract.py)

        This module has two possible ways of operation. If 7zip is installed on the system, this module extracts files from an ISO into a
        temporary directory and copies files to a given destination, if needed. If the user has mount-capabilities (CAP_SYS_ADMIN on
        Linux) this module mounts the ISO image to a temporary location, and copies files to a given destination, if needed.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= dest
        The destination directory to extract files to.

        type: path

- executable
        The path to the `7z' executable to use for extracting files from the ISO.
        [Default: 7z]
        type: path
        version_added: 2.4

= files
        A list of files to extract from the image.
        Extracting directories does not work.

        type: list

- force
        If `yes', which will replace the remote file when contents are different than the source.
        If `no', the file will only be extracted and copied if the destination does not already exist.
        (Aliases: thirsty)[Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

= image
        The ISO image to extract files from.
        (Aliases: path, src)
        type: path


NOTES:
      * Only the file checksum (content) is taken into account when extracting files from the ISO image. If `force=no', only checks
        the presence of the file.
      * In Ansible 2.3 this module was using `mount' and `umount' commands only, requiring root access. This is no longer needed
        with the introduction of 7zip for extraction.


REQUIREMENTS:  Either 7z (from `7zip' or `p7zip' package), Or mount capabilities (root-access, or CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability on Linux)
