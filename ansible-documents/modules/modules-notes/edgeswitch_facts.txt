> EDGESWITCH_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/edgeswitch/edgeswitch_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running Ubiquiti Edgeswitch.  This module prepends all of the
        base network fact keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and
        can enable or disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        config, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with an initial `[!]'
        to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: !config]


NOTES:
      * Tested against Edgeswitch 1.7.4
