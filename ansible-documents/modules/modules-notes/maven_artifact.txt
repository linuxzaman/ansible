> MAVEN_ARTIFACT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/packaging/language/maven_artifact.py)

        Downloads an artifact from a maven repository given the maven coordinates provided to the module. Can retrieve snapshots or
        release versions of the artifact and will resolve the latest available version if one is not available.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= artifact_id
        The maven artifactId coordinate


- attributes
        The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.
        To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr' on the target system.
        This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr'.
        The `=' operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+' or `-' operators need to be included in the string.
        (Aliases: attr)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

- classifier
        The maven classifier coordinate
        [Default: (null)]

= dest
        The path where the artifact should be written to
        If file mode or ownerships are specified and destination path already exists, they affect the downloaded file


- extension
        The maven type/extension coordinate
        [Default: jar]

- group
        Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= group_id
        The Maven groupId coordinate


- headers
        Add custom HTTP headers to a request in hash/dict format.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.8

- keep_name
        If `yes', the downloaded artifact's name is preserved, i.e the version number remains part of it.
        This option only has effect when `dest' is a directory and `version' is set to `latest'.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- mode
        The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.
        For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod' remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that
        Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644' or `01777') or quote it (like `'644'' or `'1777'') so Ansible
        receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
        Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
        results.
        As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx' or `u=rw,g=r,o=r').
        As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string `preserve'.
        When set to `preserve' the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- owner
        Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- password
        The password to authenticate with to the Maven Repository. Use AWS secret access key of the repository is hosted on S3
        (Aliases: aws_secret_access_key)[Default: (null)]

- repository_url
        The URL of the Maven Repository to download from.
        Use s3://... if the repository is hosted on Amazon S3, added in version 2.2.
        Use file://... if the repository is local, added in version 2.6
        [Default: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2]

- selevel
        The level part of the SELinux file context.
        This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range'.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `level' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: s0]
        type: str

- serole
        The role part of the SELinux file context.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `role' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- setype
        The type part of the SELinux file context.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `type' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- seuser
        The user part of the SELinux file context.
        By default it uses the `system' policy, where applicable.
        When set to `_default', it will use the `user' portion of the policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        The desired state of the artifact
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- timeout
        Specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection attempt
        [Default: 10]
        version_added: 2.3

- unsafe_writes
        Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.
        By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but
        sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be
        updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
        This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't
        force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
        IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2

- username
        The username to authenticate as to the Maven Repository. Use AWS secret key of the repository is hosted on S3
        (Aliases: aws_secret_key)[Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be set to `no' when no other option exists.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.9.3

- verify_checksum
        If `never', the md5 checksum will never be downloaded and verified.
        If `download', the md5 checksum will be downloaded and verified only after artifact download. This is the default.
        If `change', the md5 checksum will be downloaded and verified if the destination already exist, to verify if they are identical.
        This was the behaviour before 2.6. Since it downloads the md5 before (maybe) downloading the artifact, and since some repository
        software, when acting as a proxy/cache, return a 404 error if the artifact has not been cached yet, it may fail unexpectedly. If
        you still need it, you should consider using `always' instead - if you deal with a checksum, it is better to use it to verify
        integrity after download.
        `always' combines `download' and `change'.
        (Choices: never, download, change, always)[Default: download]
        version_added: 2.6

- version
        The maven version coordinate
        [Default: latest]


REQUIREMENTS:  lxml, boto if using a S3 repository (s3://...)
