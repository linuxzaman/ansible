NOTES:
      * Ansible uses the `cs' library's configuration method if credentials are not provided by the arguments `api_url', `api_key',
        `api_secret'. Configuration is read from several locations, in the following order. The `CLOUDSTACK_ENDPOINT',
        `CLOUDSTACK_KEY', `CLOUDSTACK_SECRET' and `CLOUDSTACK_METHOD'. `CLOUDSTACK_TIMEOUT' environment variables. A
        `CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG' environment variable pointing to an `.ini' file. A `cloudstack.ini' file in the current working
        directory. A `.cloudstack.ini' file in the users home directory. Optionally multiple credentials and endpoints can be
        specified using ini sections in `cloudstack.ini'. Use the argument `api_region' to select the section name, default section
        is `cloudstack'. See https://github.com/exoscale/cs for more information.
      * A detailed guide about cloudstack modules can be found in the L(CloudStack Cloud
        Guide,../scenario_guides/guide_cloudstack.html).
      * This module supports check mode.
