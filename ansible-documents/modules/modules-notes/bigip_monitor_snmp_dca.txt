> BIGIP_MONITOR_SNMP_DCA    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_monitor_snmp_dca.py)

        The BIG-IP has an SNMP data collecting agent (DCA) that can query remote SNMP agents of various types, including the UC Davis
        agent (UCD) and the Windows 2000 Server agent (WIN2000).

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int

        version_added: 2.5
        

- time_until_up
        Specifies the number of seconds to wait after a resource first responds correctly to the monitor before setting the resource to
        'up'. During the interval, all responses from the resource must be correct. When the interval expires, the resource is marked
        'up'. A value of 0, means that the resource is marked up immediately upon receipt of the first correct response. When creating a
        new monitor, the default is `0'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- timeout
        Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request. When creating a new monitor, the
        default is `30' seconds. If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered 'up'. If the target does not respond
        within the set time period, it is considered 'down'. When this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the interval from the
        parent monitor. Note that `timeout' and `time_until_up' combine to control when a resource is set to up.

        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0

- version

        that the host server uses SNMP version 1. When `v2c', specifies that the host server uses SNMP version 2c.
        (Choices: v1, v2c)[Default: (null)]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
      * This module does not support the `variables' option because this option is broken in the REST API and does not function
        correctly in `tmsh'; for example you cannot remove user-defined params. Therefore, there is no way to automatically
        configure it.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
