        Create and optionally attach an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) to an instance. If an ENI ID or private_ip is provided, the
        existing ENI (if any) will be modified. The 'attached' parameter controls the attachment status of the network interface.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- allow_reassignment
        Indicates whether to allow an IP address that is already assigned to another network interface or instance to be reassigned to
        the specified network interface.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.7
        

- attached
        Specifies if network interface should be attached or detached from instance. If omitted, attachment status won't change
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2
        

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- delete_on_termination
        Delete the interface when the instance it is attached to is terminated. You can only specify this flag when the interface is
        being modified, not on creation.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- description
        Optional description of the ENI.
        [Default: (null)]

- device_index
        The index of the device for the network interface attachment on the instance.
        [Default: 0]

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- eni_id
        The ID of the ENI (to modify); if null and state is present, a new eni will be created.
        [Default: (null)]

- force_detach
        Force detachment of the interface. This applies either when explicitly detaching the interface by setting instance_id to None or
        when deleting an interface with state=absent.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- instance_id
        Instance ID that you wish to attach ENI to. Since version 2.2, use the 'attached' parameter to attach or detach an ENI. Prior to
        2.2, to detach an ENI from an instance, use 'None'.
        [Default: (null)]

- private_ip_address
        Private IP address.
        [Default: (null)]

- profile
        Uses a boto profile. Only works with boto >= 2.24.0.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 1.6

- purge_secondary_private_ip_addresses

        those specified. Set secondary_private_ip_addresses to an empty list to purge all secondary addresses.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5
        

- region
        The AWS region to use. If not specified then the value of the AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION environment variable, if any, is used. See
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region
        (Aliases: aws_region, ec2_region)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- secondary_private_ip_address_count
        The number of secondary IP addresses to assign to the network interface. This option is mutually exclusive of
        secondary_private_ip_addresses
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.2
        

- secondary_private_ip_addresses
        A list of IP addresses to assign as secondary IP addresses to the network interface. This option is mutually exclusive of

        type: str

- source_dest_check
        By default, interfaces perform source/destination checks. NAT instances however need this check to be disabled. You can only
        specify this flag when the interface is being modified, not on creation.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- state
        Create or delete ENI
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- subnet_id
        ID of subnet in which to create the ENI.

- validate_certs
        When set to "no", SSL certificates will not be validated for boto versions >= 2.6.0.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.5


NOTES:
      * This module identifies and ENI based on either the eni_id, a combination of private_ip_address and subnet_id, or a
        combination of instance_id and device_id. Any of these options will let you specify a particular ENI.
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  python >= 2.6, boto
