> VYOS_CONFIG    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/vyos/vyos_config.py)

        This module provides configuration file management of VyOS devices. It provides arguments for managing both the configuration
        file and state of the active configuration. All configuration statements are based on `set` and `delete` commands in the device
        configuration.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- backup
        The `backup' argument will backup the current devices active configuration to the Ansible control host prior to making any
        changes. If the `backup_options' value is not given, the backup file will be located in the backup folder in the playbook root
        directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- backup_options
        This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when
        `backup' is set to `yes', if `backup' is set to `no' this option will be silently ignored.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          dir_path:
            description:
            - This option provides the path ending with directory name in which the backup
              configuration file will be stored. If the directory does not exist it will be
              first created and the filename is either the value of `filename' or default
              filename as described in `filename' options description. If the path value
              is not given in that case a `backup' directory will be created in the current
              working directory and backup configuration will be copied in `filename' within
              `backup' directory.
            type: path
          filename:
            description:
            - The filename to be used to store the backup configuration. If the the filename
              is not given it will be generated based on the hostname, current time and date
              in format defined by <hostname>_config.<current-date>@<current-time>
        
        type: dict
        version_added: 2.8

- comment
        Allows a commit description to be specified to be included when the configuration is committed.  If the configuration is not
        changed or committed, this argument is ignored.
        [Default: configured by vyos_config]

- config
        The `config' argument specifies the base configuration to use to compare against the desired configuration.  If this value is not
        specified, the module will automatically retrieve the current active configuration from the remote device.
        [Default: (null)]

- lines
        The ordered set of configuration lines to be managed and compared with the existing configuration on the remote device.
        [Default: (null)]

- match
        The `match' argument controls the method used to match against the current active configuration.  By default, the desired config
        is matched against the active config and the deltas are loaded.  If the `match' argument is set to `none' the active
        configuration is ignored and the configuration is always loaded.
        (Choices: line, none)[Default: line]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(Network Guide, ../network/getting_started/network_differences.html#multiple-communication-
        protocols).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict

- save
        The `save' argument controls whether or not changes made to the active configuration are saved to disk.  This is independent of
        committing the config.  When set to True, the active configuration is saved.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- src
        The `src' argument specifies the path to the source config file to load.  The source config file can either be in bracket format
        or set format.  The source file can include Jinja2 template variables.
        [Default: (null)]
