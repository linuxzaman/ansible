> BIGIP_GTM_VIRTUAL_SERVER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_gtm_virtual_server.py)

        Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM virtual servers. A GTM server can have many virtual servers associated with it. They are arranged in much
        the same way that pool members are to pools.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        Specifies the IP Address of the virtual server.
        When creating a new GTM virtual server, this parameter is required.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6
        

- availability_requirements
        Specifies, if you activate more than one health monitor, the number of health monitors that must receive successful responses in
        order for the link to be considered available.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          at_least:
            description:
            - Specifies the minimum number of active health monitors that must be successful
              before the link is considered up.
            - This parameter is only relevant when a `type' of `at_least' is used.
            - This parameter will be ignored if a type of either `all' or `require' is used.

          number_of_probers:
            description:

            - When creating a new virtual server, if this parameter is specified, then the
              `number_of_probes' parameter must also be specified.
            - The value of this parameter should always be *higher* than, or *equal to*,
              the value of `number_of_probers'.
            - This parameter is only relevant when a `type' of `require' is used.

              `number_of_probers' parameter must also be specified.
            - The value of this parameter should always be *lower* than, or *equal to*,
              the value of `number_of_probers'.
            - This parameter is only relevant when a `type' of `require' is used.

- limits
        Specifies resource thresholds or limit requirements at the server level.
        When you enable one or more limit settings, the system then uses that data to take servers in and out of service.
        You can define limits for any or all of the limit settings. However, when a server does not meet the resource threshold limit
        requirement, the system marks the entire server as unavailable and directs load-balancing traffic to another resource.
        The limit settings available depend on the type of server.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
