EXAMPLES:

# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Add new storage connection:
- ovirt_storage_connection:
    storage: myiscsi
    address: 10.34.63.199
    target: iqn.2016-08-09.domain-01:nickname
    port: 3260
    type: iscsi

# Update the existing storage connection address:
- ovirt_storage_connection:
    id: 26915c96-92ff-47e5-9e77-b581db2f2d36
    address: 10.34.63.204
    force: true

# Remove storage connection:
- ovirt_storage_connection:
    id: 26915c96-92ff-47e5-9e77-b581db2f2d36


RETURN VALUES:

id:
    description: ID of the storage connection which is managed
    returned: On success if storage connection is found.
    type: str
    sample: 7de90f31-222c-436c-a1ca-7e655bd5b60c
