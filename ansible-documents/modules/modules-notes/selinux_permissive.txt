OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= domain
        The domain that will be added or removed from the list of permissive domains.
        (Aliases: name)[Default: ]
        type: str

- no_reload
        Disable reloading of the SELinux policy after making change to a domain's permissive setting.
        The default is `no', which causes policy to be reloaded when a domain changes state.

        type: bool

= permissive
        Indicate if the domain should or should not be set as permissive.

        type: bool

        Name of the SELinux policy store to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * Requires a recent version of SELinux and `policycoreutils-python' (EL 6 or newer).
