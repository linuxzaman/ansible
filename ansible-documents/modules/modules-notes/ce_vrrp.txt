        Disable the flowdown function for service VRRP.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- admin_ignore_if_down
        mVRRP ignores an interface Down event.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- admin_interface
        Tracked mVRRP interface name. The value is a string of 1 to 63 characters.
        [Default: (null)]

        Tracked mVRRP ID. The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 255.
        [Default: (null)]

- advertise_interval
        Configured interval between sending advertisements, in milliseconds. Only the master router sends VRRP advertisements. The
        default value is 1000 milliseconds.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_key
        This object is set based on the authentication type. When noAuthentication is specified, the value is empty. When
        simpleTextPassword or md5Authentication is specified, the value is a string of 1 to 8 characters in plaintext and displayed as a
        blank text for security.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_mode
        Authentication type used for VRRP packet exchanges between virtual routers. The values are noAuthentication, simpleTextPassword,
        md5Authentication. The default value is noAuthentication.
        (Choices: simple, md5, none)[Default: (null)]

- fast_resume
        mVRRP's fast resume mode.
        (Choices: enable, disable)[Default: (null)]

- gratuitous_arp_interval
        Interval at which gratuitous ARP packets are sent, in seconds. The value ranges from 30 to 1200.The default value is 300.
        [Default: (null)]

- holding_multiplier
        The configured holdMultiplier.The value is an integer ranging from 3 to 10. The default value is 3.
        [Default: (null)]

- interface
        Name of an interface. The value is a string of 1 to 63 characters.
        [Default: (null)]

- is_plain
        Select the display mode of an authentication key. By default, an authentication key is displayed in ciphertext.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- preempt_timer_delay
        Preemption delay. The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 3600. The default value is 0.
        [Default: (null)]

- priority
        Configured VRRP priority. The value ranges from 1 to 254. The default value is 100. A larger value indicates a higher priority.
        [Default: (null)]

- recover_delay
        Delay in recovering after an interface goes Up. The delay is used for interface flapping suppression. The value is an integer
        ranging from 0 to 3600. The default value is 0 seconds.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Specify desired state of the resource.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- version
        VRRP version. The default version is v2.
        (Choices: v2, v3)[Default: (null)]

- virtual_ip
        Virtual IP address. The value is a string of 0 to 255 characters.
        [Default: (null)]

- vrid
        VRRP backup group ID. The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 255.
        [Default: present]

- vrrp_type
