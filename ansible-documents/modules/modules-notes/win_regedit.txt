OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- data
        Value of the registry entry `name' in `path'.
        If not specified then the value for the property will be null for the corresponding `type'.
        Binary and None data should be expressed in a yaml byte array or as comma separated hex values.
        An easy way to generate this is to run `regedit.exe' and use the `export' option to save the registry values to a file.
        In the exported file, binary value will look like `hex:be,ef,be,ef', the `hex:' prefix is optional.
        DWORD and QWORD values should either be represented as a decimal number or a hex value.
        Multistring values should be passed in as a list.
        See the examples for more details on how to format this data.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- delete_key
        When `state' is 'absent' then this will delete the entire key.
        If `no' then it will only clear out the '(Default)' property for that key.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- hive
        A path to a hive key like C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT to load in the registry.
        This hive is loaded under the HKLM:\ANSIBLE key which can then be used in `name' like any other path.
        This can be used to load the default user profile registry hive or any other hive saved as a file.
        Using this function requires the user to have the `SeRestorePrivilege' and `SeBackupPrivilege' privileges enabled.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path
        version_added: 2.5

- name
        Name of the registry entry in the above `path' parameters.
        If not provided, or empty then the '(Default)' property for the key will be used.
        (Aliases: entry)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

= path
        Name of the registry path.
        Should be in one of the following registry hives: HKCC, HKCR, HKCU, HKLM, HKU.
        (Aliases: key)
        type: str

- state
        The state of the registry entry.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- type
        The registry value data type.
        (Aliases: datatype)(Choices: binary, dword, expandstring, multistring, string, qword)[Default: string]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * Check-mode `-C/--check' and diff output `-D/--diff' are supported, so that you can test every change against the active
        configuration before applying changes.
      * Beware that some registry hives (`HKEY_USERS' in particular) do not allow to create new registry paths in the root folder.
      * Since ansible 2.4, when checking if a string registry value has changed, a case-sensitive test is used. Previously the test
        was case-insensitive.
