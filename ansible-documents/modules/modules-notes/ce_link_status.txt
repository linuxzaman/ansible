        Get interface link status on HUAWEI CloudEngine switches.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= interface
        For the interface parameter, you can enter `all' to display information about all interface, an interface type such as `40GE' to
        display information about interfaces of the specified type, or full name of an interface such as `40GE1/0/22' or `vlanif10' to
        display information about the specific interface.



NOTES:
      * Current physical state shows an interface's physical status.
      * Current link state shows an interface's link layer protocol status.
      * Current IPv4 state shows an interface's IPv4 protocol status.
      * Current IPv6 state shows an interface's  IPv6 protocol status.
      * Inbound octets(bytes) shows the number of bytes that an interface received.
      * Inbound unicast(pkts) shows the number of unicast packets that an interface received.
      * Inbound multicast(pkts) shows the number of multicast packets that an interface received.
      * Inbound broadcast(pkts) shows  the number of broadcast packets that an interface received.
      * Inbound error(pkts) shows the number of error packets that an interface received.
      * Inbound drop(pkts) shows the total number of packets that were sent to the interface but dropped by an interface.
      * Inbound rate(byte/sec) shows the rate at which an interface receives bytes within an interval.
      * Inbound rate(pkts/sec) shows the rate at which an interface receives packets within an interval.
      * Outbound octets(bytes) shows the number of the bytes that an interface sent.
      * Outbound unicast(pkts) shows  the number of unicast packets that an interface sent.
      * Outbound multicast(pkts) shows the number of multicast packets that an interface sent.
      * Outbound broadcast(pkts) shows the number of broadcast packets that an interface sent.
      * Outbound error(pkts) shows the total number of packets that an interface sent but dropped by the remote interface.
      * Outbound drop(pkts) shows the number of dropped packets that an interface sent.
      * Outbound rate(byte/sec) shows the rate at which an interface sends bytes within an interval.
      * Outbound rate(pkts/sec) shows the rate at which an interface sends packets within an interval.
      * Speed shows the rate for an Ethernet interface.
