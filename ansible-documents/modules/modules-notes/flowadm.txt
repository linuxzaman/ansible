> FLOWADM    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/illumos/flowadm.py)

        Create/modify/remove networking bandwidth and associated resources for a type of traffic on a particular link.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- dsfield
        - Identifies the 8-bit differentiated services field (as defined in RFC 2474). The optional dsfield_mask is used to state the
        bits of interest in the differentiated services field when comparing with the dsfield value. Both values must be in hexadecimal.
        [Default: (null)]

- link
        Specifiies a link to configure flow on.
        [Default: (null)]

- local_ip
        Identifies a network flow by the local IP address.
        [Default: (null)]

- local_port
        Identifies a service specified by the local port.
        [Default: (null)]

- maxbw
        - Sets the full duplex bandwidth for the flow. The bandwidth is specified as an integer with one of the scale suffixes(K, M, or G
        for Kbps, Mbps, and Gbps). If no units are specified, the input value will be read as Mbps.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        - A flow is defined as a set of attributes based on Layer 3 and Layer 4 headers, which can be used to identify a protocol,
        service, or a zone.
        (Aliases: flow)

- priority
        Sets the relative priority for the flow.
        (Choices: low, medium, high)[Default: medium]

- remote_ip
        Identifies a network flow by the remote IP address.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Create/delete/enable/disable an IP address on the network interface.
        (Choices: absent, present, resetted)[Default: present]

- temporary
        Specifies that the configured flow is temporary. Temporary flows do not persist across reboots.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- transport
        - Specifies a Layer 4 protocol to be used. It is typically used in combination with `local_port' to identify the service that
        needs special attention.
        [Default: (null)]

EXAMPLES:

# Limit SSH traffic to 100M via vnic0 interface
- flowadm:
    link: vnic0
    flow: ssh_out
    transport: tcp
    local_port: 22
    maxbw: 100M
    state: present

# Reset flow properties
- flowadm:
    name: dns
    state: resetted

# Configure policy for EF PHB (DSCP value of 101110 from RFC 2598) with a bandwidth of 500 Mbps and a high priority.
- flowadm:
    link: bge0
    dsfield: '0x2e:0xfc'
    maxbw: 500M
    priority: high
    flow: efphb-flow
    state: present
