> ONEVIEW_ETHERNET_NETWORK_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/remote_management/oneview/oneview_ethernet_network_facts.py)

        Retrieve the facts about one or more of the Ethernet Networks from OneView.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- config
        Path to a .json configuration file containing the OneView client configuration. The configuration file is optional and when used
        should be present in the host running the ansible commands. If the file path is not provided, the configuration will be loaded
        from environment variables. For links to example configuration files or how to use the environment variables verify the notes
        section.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- name
        Ethernet Network name.
        [Default: (null)]

- options
        List with options to gather additional facts about an Ethernet Network and related resources. Options allowed:
        `associatedProfiles' and `associatedUplinkGroups'.
        [Default: (null)]

- params
        List of params to delimit, filter and sort the list of resources.
        params allowed: - `start': The first item to return, using 0-based indexing. - `count': The number of resources to return. -
        `filter': A general filter/query string to narrow the list of items returned. - `sort': The sort order of the returned data set.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict
