> PAGERDUTY_ALERT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/monitoring/pagerduty_alert.py)

        This module will let you trigger, acknowledge or resolve a PagerDuty incident by sending events

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_key
        The pagerduty API key (readonly access), generated on the pagerduty site.


- client
        The name of the monitoring client that is triggering this event.
        [Default: (null)]

- client_url
        The URL of the monitoring client that is triggering this event.
        [Default: (null)]

- desc
        For `triggered' `state' - Required. Short description of the problem that led to this trigger. This field (or a truncated
        version) will be used when generating phone calls, SMS messages and alert emails. It will also appear on the incidents tables in
        the PagerDuty UI. The maximum length is 1024 characters.
        For `acknowledged' or `resolved' `state' - Text that will appear in the incident's log associated with this event.
        [Default: Created via Ansible]

- incident_key
        Identifies the incident to which this `state' should be applied.
        For `triggered' `state' - If there's no open (i.e. unresolved) incident with this key, a new one will be created. If there's
        already an open incident with a matching key, this event will be appended to that incident's log. The event key provides an easy
        way to "de-dup" problem reports.
        For `acknowledged' or `resolved' `state' - This should be the incident_key you received back when the incident was first opened
        by a trigger event. Acknowledge events referencing resolved or nonexistent incidents will be discarded.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.7

        This is the "integration key" listed on a "Integrations" tab of PagerDuty service.

- name
        PagerDuty unique subdomain. Obsolete. It is not used with PagerDuty REST v2 API.
        [Default: (null)]

= service_id
        ID of PagerDuty service when incidents will be triggered, acknowledged or resolved.

        version_added: 2.7
