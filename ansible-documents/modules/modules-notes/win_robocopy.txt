> WIN_ROBOCOPY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/windows/win_robocopy.py)

        Synchronizes the contents of files/directories from a source to destination. Under the hood this just calls out to RoboCopy,
        since that should be available on most modern Windows systems.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= dest
        Destination file/directory to sync (Will receive contents of src).

        type: path

- flags
        Directly supply Robocopy flags.
        If set, `purge' and `recurse' will be ignored.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- purge
        Deletes any files/directories found in the destination that do not exist in the source.
        Toggles the `/purge' flag to RoboCopy.
        If `flags' is set, this will be ignored.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- recurse
        Includes all subdirectories (Toggles the `/e' flag to RoboCopy).
        If `flags' is set, this will be ignored.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= src
        Source file/directory to sync.

        type: path


NOTES:
      * This is not a complete port of the [synchronize] module. Unlike the [synchronize] module this only performs the sync/copy
        on the remote machine, not from the master to the remote machine.
      * This module does not currently support all Robocopy flags.
