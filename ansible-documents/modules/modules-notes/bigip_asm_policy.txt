> BIGIP_ASM_POLICY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/_bigip_asm_policy.py)

        Manage BIG-IP ASM policies.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: The bigip_asm_policy module has been split into three new modules to handle import, export and general policy management. This will allow scalability of the asm policy management as well as ease of maintenance. Additionally to further reduce the burden of having multiple smaller module F5 has created asm_policy role in Ansible Galaxy for a more declarative way of ASM policy management.

	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: bigip_asm_policy_manage


  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- active
        If `yes' will apply and activate existing inactive policy. If `no', it will deactivate existing active policy. Generally should
        be `yes' only in cases where you want to activate new or existing policy.

        type: bool

- file
        Full path to a policy file to be imported into the BIG-IP ASM.
        Policy files exported from newer versions of BIG-IP cannot be imported into older versions of BIG-IP. The opposite, however, is
        true; you can import older into newer.
        [Default: (null)]

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
