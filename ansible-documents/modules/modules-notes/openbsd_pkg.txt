        Manage packages on OpenBSD using the pkg tools.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- build
        Build the package from source instead of downloading and installing a binary. Requires that the port source tree is already
        installed. Automatically builds and installs the 'sqlports' package, if it is not already installed.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.1

- clean
        When updating or removing packages, delete the extra configuration file(s) in the old packages which are annotated with @extra in
        the packaging-list.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.3

= name
        A name or a list of names of the packages.


- ports_dir
        When used in combination with the `build' option, allows overriding the default ports source directory.
        [Default: /usr/ports]
        version_added: 2.1

- quick
        Replace or delete packages quickly; do not bother with checksums before removing normal files.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.3

- state
        `present' will make sure the package is installed. `latest' will make sure the latest version of the package is installed.
        `absent' will make sure the specified package is not installed.
        (Choices: absent, latest, present)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * When used with a `loop:` each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly
        to the `name` option.


REQUIREMENTS:  python >= 2.5
