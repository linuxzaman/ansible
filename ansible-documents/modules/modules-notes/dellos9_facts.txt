> DELLOS9_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/dellos9/dellos9_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running OS9.  This module prepends all of the base network fact
        keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or
        disable collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        hardware, config, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with an
        initial `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: [u'!config']]

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Password to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Path to an ssh key used to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device.  If
              the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies idle timeout (in seconds) for the connection. Useful if the console
              freezes before continuing. For example when saving configurations.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - User to authenticate the SSH session to the remote device. If the value is not
              specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict


NOTES:
      * This module requires OS9 version 9.10.0.1P13 or above.
      * This module requires an increase of the SSH connection rate limit. Use the following command `ip ssh connection-rate-limit
        60' to configure the same. This can be also be done with the [dellos9_config] module.
