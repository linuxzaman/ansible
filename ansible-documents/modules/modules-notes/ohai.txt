> OHAI    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/ohai.py)

        Similar to the [facter] module, this runs the `Ohai' discovery program (https://docs.chef.io/ohai.html) on the remote host and
        returns JSON inventory data. `Ohai' data is a bit more verbose and nested than `facter'.
