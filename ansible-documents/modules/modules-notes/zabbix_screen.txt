> ZABBIX_SCREEN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/monitoring/zabbix/zabbix_screen.py)

        This module allows you to create, modify and delete Zabbix screens and associated graph data.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- http_login_password
        Basic Auth password
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.1

= http_login_user
        Basic Auth login

        type: str
        version_added: 2.1

= login_password
        Zabbix user password.

        type: str

= login_user
        Zabbix user name.

        type: str

= screens
        List of screens to be created/updated/deleted (see example).
        If a screen has already been added, the screen name won't be updated.
        When creating or updating a screen, `screen_name' and `host_group' are required.
        When deleting a screen, the `screen_name' is required.
        Option `graphs_in_row' will limit columns of a screen and make multiple rows (default 3).
        The available states are: `present' (default) and `absent'. If the screen already exists, and the state is not `absent', the
        screen will be updated as needed.


= server_url
        URL of Zabbix server, with protocol (http or https). `url' is an alias for `server_url'.
        (Aliases: url)
        type: str

- timeout
        The timeout of API request (seconds).
        [Default: 10]
        type: int

- validate_certs
        If set to False, SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-
        signed certificates.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5


NOTES:
      * Too many concurrent updates to the same screen may cause Zabbix to return errors, see examples for a workaround if needed.
