> ONEVIEW_LOGICAL_INTERCONNECT_GROUP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/remote_management/oneview/oneview_logical_interconnect_group.py)

        Provides an interface to manage Logical Interconnect Group resources. Can create, update, or delete.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- config
        Path to a .json configuration file containing the OneView client configuration. The configuration file is optional and when used
        should be present in the host running the ansible commands. If the file path is not provided, the configuration will be loaded
        from environment variables. For links to example configuration files or how to use the environment variables verify the notes
        section.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

= data
        List with the Logical Interconnect Group properties.


- state
        Indicates the desired state for the Logical Interconnect Group resource. `absent' will remove the resource from OneView, if it
        exists. `present' will ensure data properties are compliant with OneView.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]

- validate_etag
        When the ETag Validation is enabled, the request will be conditionally processed only if the current ETag for the resource
        matches the ETag provided in the data.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool
