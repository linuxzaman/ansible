> ONYX_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/onyx/onyx_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a ONYX Mellanox network devices This module prepends all of the base network fact keys
        with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable
        collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        version, module, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with an
        initial `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: version]


NOTES:
      * Tested against ONYX 3.6
