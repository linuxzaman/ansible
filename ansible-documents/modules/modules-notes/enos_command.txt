> ENOS_COMMAND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/enos/enos_command.py)

        Sends arbitrary commands to an ENOS node and returns the results read from the device. The `enos_command' module includes an
        argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_pass
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]

- authorize
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

= commands
        List of commands to send to the remote device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If
        the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retires as
        expired.


- interval
        Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions,
        the interval indicates how long to wait before trying the command again.
        [Default: 1]

- match
        The `match' argument is used in conjunction with the `wait_for' argument to specify the match policy.  Valid values are `all' or
        `any'.  If the value is set to `all' then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If the value is set to `any' then
        only one of the values must be satisfied.
        (Choices: any, all)[Default: all]

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.

          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.

          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is

        type: dict

- retries
        Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device
        every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for' conditions.
        [Default: 10]

- wait_for
        List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving
        forward. If the conditional is not true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
