        Manipulate SNMP trap information on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- community
        Specifies the community name for the trap destination.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- destination
        Specifies the address for the trap destination. This can be either an IP address or a hostname.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        Name of the SNMP configuration endpoint.

        type: str

- network
        Specifies the name of the trap network. This option is not supported in versions of BIG-IP < 12.1.0. If used on versions <
        12.1.0, it will simply be ignored.
        The value `default' was removed in BIG-IP version 13.1.0. Specifying this value when configuring a BIG-IP will cause the module
        to stop and report an error. The usual remedy is to choose one of the other options, such as `management'.

NOTES:
      * This module only supports version v1 and v2c of SNMP.
      * The `network' option is not supported on versions of BIG-IP < 12.1.0 because the platform did not support that option until
        12.1.0. If used on versions < 12.1.0, it will simply be ignored.
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
