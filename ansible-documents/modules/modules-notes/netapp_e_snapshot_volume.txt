OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= api_password
        The password to authenticate with the SANtricity WebServices Proxy or embedded REST API.


= api_url
        The url to the SANtricity WebServices Proxy or embedded REST API.


= api_username
        The username to authenticate with the SANtricity WebServices Proxy or embedded REST API.


- full_threshold

        [Default: 85]

= name
        The name you wish to give the snapshot volume


- repo_percentage
        The size of the view in relation to the size of the base volume
        [Default: 20]

= snapshot_image_id
        The identifier of the snapshot image used to create the new snapshot volume.
        Note: You'll likely want to use the [netapp_e_facts] module to find the ID of the image you want.


= ssid
        storage array ID


= state
        Whether to create or remove the snapshot volume
        (Choices: absent, present)

= storage_pool_name
        Name of the storage pool on which to allocate the repository volume.

        The snapshot volume access mode

NOTES:

        then an `ok' status will be returned, no other changes can be made to a pre-existing snapshot volume.
