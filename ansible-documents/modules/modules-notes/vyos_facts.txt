> VYOS_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/vyos/vyos_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running VyOS.  This module prepends all of the base network fact
        keys with ansible_net_<fact>.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or disable
        collection of additional facts.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        default, config, and neighbors.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with an
        initial `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: !config]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(Network Guide, ../network/getting_started/network_differences.html#multiple-communication-
        protocols).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.

        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
