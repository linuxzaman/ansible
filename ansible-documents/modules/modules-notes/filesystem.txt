> FILESYSTEM    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/filesystem.py)

        This module creates a filesystem.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= dev
        Target path to device or image file.
        (Aliases: device)

- force
        If `yes', allows to create new filesystem on devices that already has filesystem.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

= fstype
        Filesystem type to be created.
        reiserfs support was added in 2.2.
        lvm support was added in 2.5.
        since 2.5, `dev' can be an image file.
        vfat support was added in 2.5
        ocfs2 support was added in 2.6
        f2fs support was added in 2.7
        swap support was added in 2.8
        (Aliases: type)(Choices: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, ext4dev, f2fs, lvm, ocfs2, reiserfs, xfs, vfat, swap)

- opts
        List of options to be passed to mkfs command.
        [Default: (null)]

- resizefs
        If `yes', if the block device and filesystem size differ, grow the filesystem into the space.
        Supported for `ext2', `ext3', `ext4', `ext4dev', `f2fs', `lvm', `xfs', `vfat', `swap' filesystems.
        XFS Will only grow if mounted.
        vFAT will likely fail if fatresize < 1.04.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0


NOTES:
      * Potential filesystem on `dev' are checked using `blkid', in case `blkid' isn't able to detect an existing filesystem, this
        filesystem is overwritten even if `force' is `no'.


REQUIREMENTS:  Uses tools related to the `fstype' (`mkfs') and `blkid' command. When `resizefs' is enabled, `blockdev' command is
        required too.
