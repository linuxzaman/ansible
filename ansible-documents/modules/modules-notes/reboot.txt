> REBOOT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/reboot.py)

        Reboot a machine, wait for it to go down, come back up, and respond to commands. For Windows targets, use the [win_reboot] module
        instead.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Core Team
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- connect_timeout
        Maximum seconds to wait for a successful connection to the managed hosts before trying again.
        If unspecified, the default setting for the underlying connection plugin is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- msg
        Message to display to users before reboot.
        [Default: Reboot initiated by Ansible]
        type: str

- post_reboot_delay
        Seconds to wait after the reboot command was successful before attempting to validate the system rebooted successfully.
        This is useful if you want wait for something to settle despite your connection already working.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int

- pre_reboot_delay
        Seconds to wait before reboot. Passed as a parameter to the reboot command.
        On Linux, macOS and OpenBSD, this is converted to minutes and rounded down. If less than 60, it will be set to 0.
        On Solaris and FreeBSD, this will be seconds.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int

- reboot_timeout
        Maximum seconds to wait for machine to reboot and respond to a test command.
        This timeout is evaluated separately for both reboot verification and test command success so the maximum execution time for the
        module is twice this amount.
        [Default: 600]
        type: int

- search_paths
        Paths to search on the remote machine for the `shutdown' command.
        `Only' these paths will be searched for the `shutdown' command. `PATH' is ignored in the remote node when searching for the
        `shutdown' command.
        [Default: [u'/sbin', u'/usr/sbin', u'/usr/local/sbin']]
        type: list
        version_added: 2.8

- test_command
        Command to run on the rebooted host and expect success from to determine the machine is ready for further tasks.
        [Default: whoami]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * `PATH' is ignored on the remote node when searching for the `shutdown' command. Use `search_paths' to specify locations to
        search if the default paths do not work.
