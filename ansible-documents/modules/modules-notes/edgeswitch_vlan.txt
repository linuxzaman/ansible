        This module provides declarative management of VLANs on Ubiquiti Edgeswitch network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of VLANs definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- auto_exclude
        Each of the switch interfaces will be excluded from `vlan_id' unless defined in `*_interfaces'. This is a default setting for all
        switch interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- auto_tag
        Each of the switch interfaces will be set to accept and transmit untagged frames for `vlan_id' unless defined in `*_interfaces'.
        This is a default setting for all switch interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- auto_untag
        Each of the switch interfaces will be set to accept untagged frames and transmit them tagged for `vlan_id' unless defined in
        `*_interfaces'. This is a default setting for all switch interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- excluded_interfaces
        List of interfaces that should be excluded of the VLAN. Accept range of interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        Name of the VLAN.
        [Default: (null)]

- purge
        Purge VLANs not defined in the `aggregate' parameter.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- state
        action on the VLAN configuration.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- tagged_interfaces
        List of interfaces that should accept and transmit tagged frames for the VLAN. Accept range of interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]

- untagged_interfaces
        List of interfaces that should accept untagged frames and transmit them tagged for the VLAN. Accept range of interfaces.
        [Default: (null)]

- vlan_id
        ID of the VLAN. Range 1-4093.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Tested against edgeswitch 1.7.4
      * This module use native Ubiquiti vlan syntax and does not support switchport compatibility syntax. For clarity, it is
        strongly advised to not use both syntaxes on the same interface.
      * Edgeswitch does not support deleting or changing name of VLAN 1
      * As auto_tag, auto_untag and auto_exclude are a kind of default setting for all interfaces, they are mutually exclusive
