> FORTIOS_VPN_SSL_SETTINGS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/fortios/fortios_vpn_ssl_settings.py)

        This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS by allowing the user to set and modify vpn_ssl feature and settings
        category. Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage. Tested with FOS v6.0.2

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
