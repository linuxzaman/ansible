> BIGIP_DEVICE_CONNECTIVITY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_connectivity.py)

        Manages device IP configuration settings for HA on a BIG-IP. Each BIG-IP device has synchronization and failover connectivity
        information (IP addresses) that you define as part of HA pairing or clustering. This module allows you to configure that
        information.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- cluster_mirroring
        Specifies whether mirroring occurs within the same cluster or between different clusters on a multi-bladed system.
        This parameter is only supported on platforms that have multiple blades, such as Viprion hardware. It is not supported on VE.

NOTES:
      * This module is primarily used as a component of configuring HA pairs of BIG-IP devices.
      * Requires BIG-IP >= 12.0.0
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
