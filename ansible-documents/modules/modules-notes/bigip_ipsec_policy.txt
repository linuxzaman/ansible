        type: str

- ipcomp
        Specifies whether to use IPComp encapsulation.
        When `none', specifies that IPComp is disabled.
        When `deflate', specifies that IPComp is enabled and uses the Deflate compression algorithm.
        (Choices: none, null, deflate)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- kb_lifetime
        Specifies the length of time, in kilobytes, before the IKE security association expires.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- lifetime

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
