> PANOS_QUERY_RULES    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/panos/_panos_query_rules.py)

        - Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed. The policy rules are
        compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and because the first rule that matches the traffic is applied, the more
        specific rules must precede the more general ones.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Consolidating code base.
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use U(https://galaxy.ansible.com/PaloAltoNetworks/paloaltonetworks) instead.
