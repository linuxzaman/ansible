> EOS_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/eos/eos_interface.py)

        This module provides declarative management of Interfaces on Arista EOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of Interfaces definitions. Each of the entry in aggregate list should define name of interface `name' and other options as
        required.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- delay
        Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. This wait is applicable for operational state
        argument which are `state' with values `up'/`down', `tx_rate' and `rx_rate'.
        [Default: 10]

- description
        Description of Interface upto 240 characters.
        [Default: (null)]

- enabled
        Interface link status. If the value is `True' the interface state will be enabled, else if value is `False' interface will be in
        disable (shutdown) state.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- mtu
        Set maximum transmission unit size in bytes of transmit packet for the interface given in `name' option.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the Interface to be configured on remote device. The name of interface should be in expanded format and not abbreviated.


- neighbors
        Check the operational state of given interface `name' for LLDP neighbor.
        The following suboptions are available.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - LLDP neighbor host for given interface `name'.
          port:
            description:
            - LLDP neighbor port to which given interface `name' is connected.
        

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
