NOTES:
      * Specifying a name of "all" for any asset type will export all items of that asset type.
      * If no `config_file' is provided we will attempt to use the tower-cli library defaults to find your Tower host information.
      * `config_file' should contain Tower configuration in the following format host=hostname username=username password=password
