> BIGIQ_UTILITY_LICENSE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigiq_utility_license.py)

        Manages utility licenses on a BIG-IQ. Utility licenses are one form of licenses that BIG-IQ can distribute. These licenses,
        unlike regkey licenses, do not require a pool to be created before creation. Additionally, when assigning them, you assign by
        offering instead of key.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.


REQUIREMENTS:  BIG-IQ >= 5.3.0
