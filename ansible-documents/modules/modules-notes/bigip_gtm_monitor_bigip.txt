> BIGIP_GTM_MONITOR_BIGIP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_gtm_monitor_bigip.py)

        Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM BIG-IP monitors. This monitor is used by GTM to monitor BIG-IPs themselves.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate_dynamic_ratios
        Specifies how the system combines the module values to create the proportion (score) for the load balancing operation.
        The score represents the module's estimated capacity for handing traffic.
        Averaged values are appropriate for downstream Web Accelerator or Application Security Manager virtual servers.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not specified, the default of `none' is used, meaning that the system does not
        use the scores in the load balancing operation.
        When `none', specifies that the monitor ignores the nodes and pool member scores.
        When `average-nodes', specifies that the system averages the dynamic ratios on the nodes associated with the monitor's target
        virtual servers and returns that average as the virtual servers' score.
        When `sum-nodes', specifies that the system adds together the scores of the nodes associated with the monitor's target virtual
        servers and uses that value in the load balancing operation.
        When `average-members', specifies that the system averages the dynamic ratios on the pool members associated with the monitor's
        target virtual servers and returns that average as the virtual servers' score.
        When `sum-members', specifies that the system adds together the scores of the pool members associated with the monitor's target
        virtual servers and uses that value in the load balancing operation.
        (Choices: none, average-nodes, sum-nodes, average-members, sum-members)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- ignore_down_response
        Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval.
        When `yes', specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of the monitor timeout. Once the monitor timeout
        is reached without the system receiving an up response, the system marks the object down.
        When `no', specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down when it receives a down response.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `no'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- interval
        Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check when either the resource is down or the status
        of the resource is unknown.
        When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `30'. This value *must* be less
        than the `timeout' value.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- ip
        IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value
        will be '*'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= name
        Monitor name.

        type: str

- parent
        The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the
        `bigip' parent on the `Common' partition.
        [Default: /Common/bigip]
        type: str

- partition
        Device partition to manage resources on.
        [Default: Common]
        type: str

        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)
        type: str

- port
        Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default
        value will be '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1 and 65535 must be specified
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

NOTES:
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
