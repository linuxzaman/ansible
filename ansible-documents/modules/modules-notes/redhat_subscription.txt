  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- activationkey
        supply an activation key for use with registration
        [Default: (null)]

        Added in favor of deprecated autosubscribe in 2.5.

        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5

- consumer_id
        References an existing consumer ID to resume using a previous registration for this system. If the  system's identity certificate
        is lost or corrupted, this option allows it to resume using its previous identity and subscriptions. The default is to not
        specify a consumer ID so a new ID is created.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- consumer_name
        Name of the system to register, defaults to the hostname
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- consumer_type
        The type of unit to register, defaults to system
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- environment
        Register with a specific environment in the destination org. Used with Red Hat Satellite 6.x or Katello

        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.0

- password
        access.redhat.com or Sat6 password
        [Default: (null)]

- pool
        Specify a subscription pool name to consume.  Regular expressions accepted. Use `pool_ids' instead if possible, as it is much
        faster. Mutually exclusive with `pool_ids'.
        [Default: ^$]

- pool_ids
        Specify subscription pool IDs to consume. Prefer over `pool' when possible as it is much faster. A pool ID may be specified as a
        `string' - just the pool ID (ex. `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'), or as a `dict' with the pool ID as the key, and a quantity
        as the value (ex. `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef: 2'. If the quantity is provided, it is used to consume multiple entitlements
        from a pool (the pool must support this). Mutually exclusive with `pool'.

        version_added: 2.4

- release
        Set a release version
        [Default: (null)]

        [Default: (null)]

        version_added: 2.4

NOTES:
      * In order to register a system, subscription-manager requires either a username and password, or an activationkey and an
        Organization ID.
      * Since 2.5 values for `server_hostname', `server_insecure', `rhsm_baseurl', `server_proxy_hostname', `server_proxy_port',
        `server_proxy_user' and `server_proxy_password' are no longer taken from the `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf' config file and default
        to None.
