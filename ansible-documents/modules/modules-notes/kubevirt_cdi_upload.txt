OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- api_key
        Token used to authenticate with the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_API_KEY environment variable.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- ca_cert
        Path to a CA certificate used to authenticate with the API. The full certificate chain must be provided to avoid certificate
        validation errors. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_SSL_CA_CERT environment variable.
        (Aliases: ssl_ca_cert)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- client_cert
        Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_CERT_FILE environment variable.
        (Aliases: cert_file)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- client_key
        Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_KEY_FILE environment variable.
        (Aliases: key_file)[Default: (null)]
        type: path

- context
        The name of a context found in the config file. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_CONTEXT environment variable.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- host
        Provide a URL for accessing the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_HOST environment variable.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- kubeconfig
        Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection options are provided, the openshift client
        will attempt to load the default configuration file from `~/.kube/config.json'. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_KUBECONFIG
        environment variable.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- merge_type
        Whether to override the default patch merge approach with a specific type. By default, the strategic merge will typically be
        used.
        (Choices: json, merge, strategic-merge)[Default: (null)]
        type: list

- password
        Provide a password for authenticating with the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_PASSWORD environment variable.
        Please read the description of the `username' option for a discussion of when this option is applicable.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- path
        Path of local image file to transfer.
        [Default: (null)]

= pvc_name
        Use to specify the name of the target PersistentVolumeClaim.


= pvc_namespace
        Use to specify the namespace of the target PersistentVolumeClaim.


- upload_host
        URL containing the host and port on which the CDI Upload Proxy is available.
        More info: https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/blob/master/doc/upload.md#expose-cdi-uploadproxy-service
        [Default: (null)]

- upload_host_validate_certs
        Whether or not to verify the CDI Upload Proxy's SSL certificates against your system's CA trust store.
        (Aliases: upload_host_verify_ssl)[Default: True]
        type: bool

- username
        Provide a username for authenticating with the API. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_USERNAME environment variable.
        Please note that this only works with clusters configured to use HTTP Basic Auth. If your cluster has a different form of
        authentication (e.g. OAuth2 in OpenShift), this option will not work as expected and you should look into the `k8s_auth' module,
        as that might do what you need.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- validate_certs
        Whether or not to verify the API server's SSL certificates. Can also be specified via K8S_AUTH_VERIFY_SSL environment variable.
        (Aliases: verify_ssl)[Default: (null)]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * The OpenShift Python client wraps the K8s Python client, providing full access to all of the APIS and models available on
        both platforms. For API version details and additional information visit https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-
        python
      * To avoid SSL certificate validation errors when `validate_certs' is `True', the full certificate chain for the API server
        must be provided via `ca_cert' or in the kubeconfig file.


REQUIREMENTS:  python >= 2.7, openshift >= 0.8.2, requests >= 2.0.0
