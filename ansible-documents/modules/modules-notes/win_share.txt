REQUIREMENTS:  As this module used newer cmdlets like New-SmbShare this can only run on Windows 8 / Windows 2012 or newer., This is
        due to the reliance on the WMI provider MSFT_SmbShare https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh830471 which was
        only added with these Windows releases.
