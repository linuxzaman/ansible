  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- folder
        Destination folder path to find an existing guest.
        The folder should include the datacenter. ESX's datacenter is ha-datacenter
        Examples:
           folder: /ha-datacenter/vm
           folder: ha-datacenter/vm
           folder: /datacenter1/vm
           folder: datacenter1/vm
           folder: /datacenter1/vm/folder1
           folder: datacenter1/vm/folder1
           folder: /folder1/datacenter1/vm
           folder: folder1/datacenter1/vm
           folder: /folder1/datacenter1/vm/folder2
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- force
        Ignore warnings and complete the actions.
        This parameter is useful while forcing virtual machine state.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.5
        

- hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_HOST' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- name
        Name of the virtual machine to work with.
        Virtual machine names in vCenter are not necessarily unique, which may be problematic, see `name_match'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- name_match
        If multiple virtual machines matching the name, use the first or last found.
        (Choices: first, last)[Default: first]
        type: str

- password
        The password of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PASSWORD' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- port
        The port number of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PORT' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.5

- scheduled_at
        Date and time in string format at which specificed task needs to be performed.
        The required format for date and time - 'dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm'.
        Scheduling task requires vCenter server. A standalone ESXi server does not support this option.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        Set the state of the virtual machine.
        (Choices: powered-off, powered-on, reboot-guest, restarted, shutdown-guest, suspended, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

- state_change_timeout
        If the `state' is set to `shutdown-guest', by default the module will return immediately after sending the shutdown signal.
        If this argument is set to a positive integer, the module will instead wait for the VM to reach the poweredoff state.
        The value sets a timeout in seconds for the module to wait for the state change.
        [Default: 0]
        version_added: 2.6

- use_instance_uuid
        Whether to use the VMWare instance UUID rather than the BIOS UUID.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- username
        The username of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_USER' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: admin, user)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- uuid
        UUID of the instance to manage if known, this is VMware's unique identifier.
        This is required if name is not supplied.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- validate_certs
        Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to `false' when certificates are not trusted.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_VALIDATE_CERTS' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        If set to `yes', please make sure Python >= 2.7.9 is installed on the given machine.
