OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- cmd
        List of commands assigned to the rule.

        Command category the rule applies to.
        (Choices: all)[Default: (null)]

        List of hosts assigned to the rule.
        If an empty list is passed all hosts will be removed from the rule.
        If option is omitted hosts will not be checked or changed.
        Option `hostcategory' must be omitted to assign hosts.
        [Default: (null)]

- hostcategory
        Host category the rule applies to.
        If 'all' is passed one must omit `host' and `hostgroup'.
        Option `host' and `hostgroup' must be omitted to assign 'all'.
        (Choices: all)[Default: (null)]

- hostgroup
        List of host groups assigned to the rule.
        If an empty list is passed all host groups will be removed from the rule.
        If option is omitted host groups will not be checked or changed.

        [Default: (null)]

- ipa_host
        IP or hostname of IPA server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `IPA_HOST' will be used instead.
        If both the environment variable `IPA_HOST' and the value are not specified in the task, then DNS will be used to try to discover
        the FreeIPA server.
        The relevant entry needed in FreeIPA is the 'ipa-ca' entry.
        If neither the DNS entry, nor the environment `IPA_HOST', nor the value are available in the task, then the default value will be
        used.
        Environment variable fallback mechanism is added in Ansible 2.5.
        [Default: ipa.example.com]
        type: str

= ipa_pass
        Password of administrative user.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `IPA_PASS' will be used instead.
        Note that if the 'urllib_gssapi' library is available, it is possible to use GSSAPI to authenticate to FreeIPA.
        If the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME' is available, the module will use this kerberos credentials cache to authenticate to the
        FreeIPA server.
        If the environment variable `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME' is available, and `KRB5CCNAME' is not; the module will use this kerberos keytab
        to authenticate.
        If GSSAPI is not available, the usage of 'ipa_pass' is required.
        Environment variable fallback mechanism is added in Ansible 2.5.

        type: str

- ipa_port
        Port of FreeIPA / IPA server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `IPA_PORT' will be used instead.
        If both the environment variable `IPA_PORT' and the value are not specified in the task, then default value is set.
        Environment variable fallback mechanism is added in Ansible 2.5.

        type: int

- ipa_prot
        Protocol used by IPA server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `IPA_PROT' will be used instead.
        If both the environment variable `IPA_PROT' and the value are not specified in the task, then default value is set.

        For bulk operations, you may want to increase this in order to avoid timeout from IPA server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `IPA_TIMEOUT' will be used instead.
        If both the environment variable `IPA_TIMEOUT' and the value are not specified in the task, then default value is set.
