        Manages Homebrew packages

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- install_options
        options flags to install a package
        (Aliases: options)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.4

- name
        list of names of packages to install/remove
        (Aliases: pkg, package, formula)[Default: (null)]

- path
        A ':' separated list of paths to search for 'brew' executable. Since a package (`formula' in homebrew parlance) location is
        prefixed relative to the actual path of `brew' command, providing an alternative `brew' path enables managing different set of
        packages in an alternative location in the system.
        [Default: /usr/local/bin]

- state
        state of the package
        (Choices: head, latest, present, absent, linked, unlinked)[Default: present]

- update_homebrew
        update homebrew itself first
        (Aliases: update-brew)[Default: no]
        type: bool

- upgrade_all
        upgrade all homebrew packages
        (Aliases: upgrade)[Default: no]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * When used with a `loop:` each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly
        to the `name` option.
