> SROS_COMMAND    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/sros/sros_command.py)

        Sends arbitrary commands to an SR OS node and returns the results read from the device. This module includes an argument that
        will cause the module to wait for a specific condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met. This module
        does not support running commands in configuration mode. Please use [sros_config] to configure SR OS devices.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= commands
        List of commands to send to the remote SR OS device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is
        returned. If the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of
        retries has expired.


- interval
        Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions,
        the interval indicates how long to wait before trying the command again.
        [Default: 1]

- match
        The `match' argument is used in conjunction with the `wait_for' argument to specify the match policy.  Valid values are `all' or
        `any'.  If the value is set to `all' then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If the value is set to `any' then
        only one of the values must be satisfied.
        (Choices: any, all)[Default: all]

- provider
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict

- retries
        Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device
        every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for' conditions.
        [Default: 10]

- wait_for
        List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving
        forward. If the conditional is not true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
        (Aliases: waitfor)[Default: (null)]
