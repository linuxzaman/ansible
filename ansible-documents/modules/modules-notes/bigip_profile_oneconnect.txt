        Manage OneConnect profiles on a BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- description
        Description of the profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- idle_timeout_override
        Specifies the number of seconds that a connection is idle before the connection flow is eligible for deletion.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        You may specify a number of seconds for the timeout override.
        When `disabled', specifies that there is no timeout override for the connection.
        When `indefinite', Specifies that a connection may be idle with no timeout override.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- limit_type
        When `none', simultaneous in-flight requests and responses over TCP connections to a pool member are counted toward the limit.
        This is the historical behavior.
        When `idle', idle connections will be dropped as the TCP connection limit is reached. For short intervals, during the overlap of
        the idle connection being dropped and the new connection being established, the TCP connection limit may be exceeded.
        When `strict', the TCP connection limit is honored with no exceptions. This means that idle connections will prevent new TCP
        connections from being made until they expire, even if they could otherwise be reused.
        `strict' is not a recommended configuration except in very special cases with short expiration timeouts.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        (Choices: none, idle, strict)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- maximum_age
        Specifies the maximum number of seconds allowed for a connection in the connection reuse pool.
        For any connection with an age higher than this value, the system removes that connection from the re-use pool.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- maximum_reuse
        Specifies the maximum number of times that a server-side connection can be reused.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- maximum_size
        Specifies the maximum number of connections that the system holds in the connection reuse pool.
        If the pool is already full, then a server-side connection closes after the response is completed.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

= name
        Specifies the name of the OneConnect profile.

        type: str

            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for

        version_added: 2.5

= server
        The BIG-IP host.
        You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

        type: str

- server_port
        The BIG-IP server port.

        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.2

- share_pools
        Indicates that connections may be shared not only within a virtual server, but also among similar virtual servers
        When `yes', all virtual servers that use the same OneConnect and other internal network profiles can share connections.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

- source_mask
        Specifies a value that the system applies to the source address to determine its eligibility for reuse.
        When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
        The system applies the value of this setting to the server-side source address to determine its eligibility for reuse.
        A mask of `0' causes the system to share reused connections across all source addresses. A host mask of `32' causes the system to
        share only those reused connections originating from the same source address.
        When you are using a SNAT or SNAT pool, the server-side source address is translated first and then the OneConnect mask is
        applied to the translated address.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
