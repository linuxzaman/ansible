> IOS_STATIC_ROUTE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/ios/ios_static_route.py)

        This module provides declarative management of static IP routes on Cisco IOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- admin_distance
        Admin distance of the static route.
        [Default: (null)]

- aggregate
        List of static route definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- interface
        Interface of the static route.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8

- mask
        Network prefix mask of the static route.
        [Default: (null)]

- name
        Name of the static route
        (Aliases: description)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.8

- next_hop
        Next hop IP of the static route.
        [Default: (null)]

- prefix
        Network prefix of the static route.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        For more information please see the L(IOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_ios.html).
