> CE_ETH_TRUNK    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/cloudengine/ce_eth_trunk.py)

        Manages Eth-Trunk specific configuration parameters on HUAWEI CloudEngine switches.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- force
        When true it forces Eth-Trunk members to match what is declared in the members param. This can be used to remove members.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- hash_type
        Hash algorithm used for load balancing among Eth-Trunk member interfaces.
        (Choices: src-dst-ip, src-dst-mac, enhanced, dst-ip, dst-mac, src-ip, src-mac)[Default: (null)]

- members
        List of interfaces that will be managed in a given Eth-Trunk. The interface name must be full name.
        [Default: (null)]

- min_links
        Specifies the minimum number of Eth-Trunk member links in the Up state. The value is an integer ranging from 1 to the maximum
        number of interfaces that can be added to a Eth-Trunk interface.
        [Default: (null)]

- mode
        Specifies the working mode of an Eth-Trunk interface.
        (Choices: manual, lacp-dynamic, lacp-static)[Default: (null)]

- state
        Manage the state of the resource.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

= trunk_id
        Eth-Trunk interface number. The value is an integer. The value range depends on the assign forward eth-trunk mode command. When
        256 is specified, the value ranges from 0 to 255. When 512 is specified, the value ranges from 0 to 511. When 1024 is specified,
        the value ranges from 0 to 1023.



NOTES:
      * `state=absent' removes the Eth-Trunk config and interface if it already exists. If members to be removed are not explicitly
        passed, all existing members (if any), are removed, and Eth-Trunk removed.
      * Members must be a list.
