> CAPABILITIES    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/capabilities.py)

        This module manipulates files privileges using the Linux capabilities(7) system.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= capability
        Desired capability to set (with operator and flags, if state is `present') or remove (if state is `absent')
        (Aliases: cap)
        type: str

= path
        Specifies the path to the file to be managed.
        (Aliases: key)
        type: str

- state
        Whether the entry should be present or absent in the file's capabilities.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str


NOTES:
      * The capabilities system will automatically transform operators and flags into the effective set, so for example,
        `cap_foo=ep' will probably become `cap_foo+ep'.
      * This module does not attempt to determine the final operator and flags to compare, so you will want to ensure that your
        capabilities argument matches the final capabilities.
