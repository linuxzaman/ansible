> ZFS_DELEGATE_ADMIN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/storage/zfs/zfs_delegate_admin.py)

        Manages ZFS file system delegated administration permissions, which allow unprivileged users to perform ZFS operations normally
        restricted to the superuser. See the `zfs allow' section of `zfs(1M') for detailed explanations of options. This module attempts
        to adhere to the behavior of the command line tool as much as possible.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- descendents
        Apply permissions to `name''s descendents (`zfs allow -d').

        Apply permissions to everyone.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

        List of groups to whom permission(s) should be granted.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- local
        Apply permissions to `name' locally (`zfs allow -l').
        [Default: (null)]
        type: bool

= name
        File system or volume name e.g. `rpool/myfs'.

        type: str

        (Choices: allow, clone, create, destroy, mount, promote, readonly, receive, rename, rollback, send, share, snapshot,
        unallow)[Default: (null)]
        type: list

EXAMPLES:

- name: Grant `zfs allow` and `unallow` permission to the `adm` user with the default local+descendents scope

    everyone: yes
    permissions: send

- name: Grant `zfs send,receive` to users `foo` and `bar` with local scope only
  zfs_delegate_admin:
