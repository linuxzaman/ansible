        This module provides declarative management of VRFs on Lenovo CNOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        List of VRFs contexts
        [Default: (null)]

- associated_interfaces
        This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vrf `name' for associated interfaces. If the value in
        the `associated_interfaces' does not match with the operational state of vrf interfaces on device it will result in failure.
        [Default: (null)]

- delay
        Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. This wait is applicable for operational state
        arguments.
        [Default: 10]

- interfaces
        Identifies the set of interfaces that should be configured in the VRF. Interfaces must be routed interfaces in order to be placed
        into a VRF. The name of interface should be in expanded format and not abbreviated.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the VRF.


- purge
        Purge VRFs not defined in the `aggregate' parameter.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- rd
        Route distinguisher of the VRF
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the VRF configuration.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

      * Tested against CNOS 10.9.1
