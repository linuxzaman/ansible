> JUNOS_STATIC_ROUTE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/junos/junos_static_route.py)

        This module provides declarative management of static IP routes on Juniper JUNOS network devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- active
        Specifies whether or not the configuration is active or deactivated
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

= address
        Network address with prefix of the static route.
        (Aliases: prefix)

- aggregate
        List of static route definitions
        [Default: (null)]

= next_hop
        Next hop IP of the static route.


- preference
        Global admin preference of the static route.
        (Aliases: admin_distance)[Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' or `connection: netconf'.
        For more information please see the L(Junos OS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.
        [Default: (null)]
        suboptions:
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 22
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  The
              port value will default to the well known SSH port of 22 (for `transport=cli')
              or port 830 (for `transport=netconf') device.
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This
              value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE'
              will be used instead.
            type: path
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error.
            type: int
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is
              not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
        
        type: dict

- qualified_next_hop
        Qualified next hop IP of the static route. Qualified next hops allow to associate preference with a particular next-hop address.
        [Default: (null)]

- qualified_preference
        Assign preference for qualified next hop.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        State of the static route configuration.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the remote device being managed.
      * Tested against vSRX JUNOS version 15.1X49-D15.4, vqfx-10000 JUNOS Version 15.1X53-D60.4.
      * Recommended connection is `netconf'. See L(the Junos OS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
      * This module also works with `local' connections for legacy playbooks.
      * For information on using CLI and netconf see the :ref:`Junos OS Platform Options guide <junos_platform_options>`
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage network devices see the :ref:`Ansible Network Guide <network_guide>`
