> SLXOS_L2_INTERFACE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/slxos/slxos_l2_interface.py)

        This module provides declarative management of Layer-2 interface on Extreme slxos devices.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- access_vlan
        Configure given VLAN in access port. If `mode=access', used as the access VLAN ID.
        [Default: (null)]

- aggregate
        List of Layer-2 interface definitions.
        [Default: (null)]

- mode
        Mode in which interface needs to be configured.
        (Choices: access, trunk)[Default: access]

= name
        Full name of the interface excluding any logical unit number, i.e. Ethernet 0/1.
        (Aliases: interface)

- native_vlan
        Native VLAN to be configured in trunk port. If `mode=trunk', used as the trunk native VLAN ID.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Manage the state of the Layer-2 Interface configuration.
        (Choices: present, absent, unconfigured)[Default: present]

- trunk_allowed_vlans
        List of allowed VLANs in a given trunk port. If `mode=trunk', these are the only VLANs that will be configured on the trunk, i.e.
        "2-10,15".
        [Default: (null)]

- trunk_vlans
        List of VLANs to be configured in trunk port. If `mode=trunk', used as the VLAN range to ADD or REMOVE from the trunk.
        [Default: (null)]

EXAMPLES:

- name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 is in its default l2 interface state
  slxos_l2_interface:
    name: Ethernet 0/5
    state: unconfigured

- name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 is configured for access vlan 20
  slxos_l2_interface:
    name: Ethernet 0/5
    mode: access
    access_vlan: 20

- name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 only has vlans 5-10 as trunk vlans
  slxos_l2_interface:
    name: Ethernet 0/5
    mode: trunk
    native_vlan: 10
    trunk_vlans: 5-10

- name: Ensure Ethernet 0/5 is a trunk port and ensure 2-50 are being tagged (doesn't mean others aren't also being tagged)
  slxos_l2_interface:
    name: Ethernet 0/5
    mode: trunk
    native_vlan: 10
    trunk_vlans: 2-50

- name: Ensure these VLANs are not being tagged on the trunk
  slxos_l2_interface:
    name: Ethernet 0/5
    mode: trunk
    trunk_vlans: 51-4094
    state: absent

  returned: always, except for the platforms that use Netconf transport to manage the device.
  type: list
  sample:
