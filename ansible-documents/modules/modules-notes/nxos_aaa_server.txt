        Manages AAA server global configuration

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Network Team
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- deadtime
        Duration for which a non-reachable AAA server is skipped, in minutes or keyword 'default. Range is 1-1440. Device default is 0.
        [Default: (null)]

- directed_request
        Enables direct authentication requests to AAA server or keyword 'default' Device default is disabled.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)[Default: (null)]

- encrypt_type
        The state of encryption applied to the entered global key. O clear text, 7 encrypted. Type-6 encryption is not supported.
        (Choices: 0, 7)[Default: (null)]

- global_key
        Global AAA shared secret or keyword 'default'.
        [Default: (null)]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using NX-API.
        For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        A dict object containing connection details.

        suboptions:
          auth_pass:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote
              device.  If `authorize' is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS'
              will be used instead.

          authorize:
            default: false
            description:
            - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending
              any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands
              in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value
              of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
            type: bool
            version_added: 2.5.3
          host:
            description:
            - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over
              the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address
              for the transport.
            required: true
            type: str
          password:
            description:
            - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              is a common argument used for either `cli' or `nxapi' transports. If the value
              is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD'
              will be used instead.
            type: str
          port:
            default: 0 (use common port)
            description:
            - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
              value applies to either `cli' or `nxapi'.  The port value will default to
              the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,
              http=80, https=443).
            type: int
          ssh_keyfile:
            description:
            - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This
              argument is only used for the `cli' transport. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will
              be used instead.
            type: str
          timeout:
            default: 10
            description:
            - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for
              either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the
              operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to return
              on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).

            default: cli
            description:
            - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device.  The
              transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or nxapi.

            type: str
          use_proxy:
            default: true
            description:
            - If `no', the environment variables `http_proxy' and `https_proxy' will be
              ignored.

          use_ssl:
            default: false
            description:
            - Configures the `transport' to use SSL if set to `yes' only when the `transport=nxapi',
              otherwise this value is ignored.
            type: bool
          username:
            description:
            - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
              device.  This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the nxapi
              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified
              in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME' will
              be used instead.

            default: true
            description:
            - If `no', SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used on
              personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
              argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
            type: bool
        
        type: dict

- server_timeout
        Global AAA server timeout period, in seconds or keyword 'default. Range is 1-60. Device default is 5.
        [Default: (null)]

= server_type
        The server type is either radius or tacacs.
        (Choices: radius, tacacs)

- state
        Manage the state of the resource.
        (Choices: present, default)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * Tested against NXOSv 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
      * The server_type parameter is always required.
      * If encrypt_type is not supplied, the global AAA server key will be stored as encrypted (type 7).
      * Changes to the global AAA server key with encrypt_type=0 are not idempotent.
      * state=default will set the supplied parameters to their default values. The parameters that you want to default must also
        be set to default. If global_key=default, the global key will be removed.
