> PACKET_DEVICE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/packet/packet_device.py)

        Manage a bare metal server in the Packet Host (a "device" in the API terms). When the machine is created it can optionally wait
        for public IP address, or for active state. This module has a dependency on packet >= 1.0. API is documented at
        https://www.packet.net/developers/api/devices.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- always_pxe
        Persist PXE as the first boot option.
        Normally, the PXE process happens only on the first boot. Set this arg to have your device continuously boot to iPXE.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- auth_token
        Packet api token. You can also supply it in env var `PACKET_API_TOKEN'.
        [Default: (null)]

- count
        The number of devices to create. Count number can be included in hostname via the %d string formatter.
        [Default: 1]

- count_offset
        From which number to start the count.
        [Default: 1]

- device_ids
        List of device IDs on which to operate.
        [Default: (null)]

- facility
        Facility slug for device creation. See Packet API for current list - https://www.packet.net/developers/api/facilities/.
        [Default: (null)]

- features
        Dict with "features" for device creation. See Packet API docs for details.
        [Default: (null)]

- hostnames
        A hostname of a device, or a list of hostnames.
        If given string or one-item list, you can use the `"%d"' Python string format to expand numbers from `count'.
        If only one hostname, it might be expanded to list if `count'>1.
        (Aliases: name)[Default: (null)]

- ipxe_script_url
        URL of custom iPXE script for provisioning.
        More about custom iPXE for Packet devices at https://help.packet.net/technical/infrastructure/custom-ipxe.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- locked
        Whether to lock a created device.
        (Aliases: lock)[Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- operating_system
        OS slug for device creation. See Packet API for current list - https://www.packet.net/developers/api/operatingsystems/.
        [Default: (null)]

- plan
        Plan slug for device creation. See Packet API for current list - https://www.packet.net/developers/api/plans/.
        [Default: (null)]

= project_id
        ID of project of the device.


- state
        Desired state of the device.
        If set to `present' (the default), the module call will return immediately after the device-creating HTTP request successfully
        returns.
        If set to `active', the module call will block until all the specified devices are in state active due to the Packet API, or
        until `wait_timeout'.
        (Choices: present, absent, active, inactive, rebooted)[Default: present]

- user_data
        Userdata blob made available to the machine
        [Default: (null)]

- wait_for_public_IPv
        Whether to wait for the instance to be assigned a public IPv4/IPv6 address.
        If set to 4, it will wait until IPv4 is assigned to the instance.
        If set to 6, wait until public IPv6 is assigned to the instance.
        (Choices: 4, 6)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.4

- wait_timeout
        How long (seconds) to wait either for automatic IP address assignment, or for the device to reach the `active' `state'.
        If `wait_for_public_IPv' is set and `state' is `active', the module will wait for both events consequently, applying the timeout
        twice.
        [Default: 900]
