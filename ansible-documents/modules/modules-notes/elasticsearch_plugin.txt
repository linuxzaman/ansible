        version_added: 2.7

= name
        Name of the plugin to install.

        Location of the plugin binary. If this file is not found, the default plugin binaries will be used.
        The default changed in Ansible 2.4 to None.
        [Default: (null)]

- plugin_dir

- src
        Optionally set the source location to retrieve the plugin from. This can be a file:// URL to install from a local file, or a

        The name parameter must match the descriptor in the plugin ZIP specified.
        Is only used if the state would change, which is solely checked based on the name parameter. If, for example, the plugin is
        already installed, changing this has no effect.
