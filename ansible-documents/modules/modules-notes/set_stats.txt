> SET_STATS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/utilities/logic/set_stats.py)

        This module allows setting/accumulating stats on the current ansible run, either per host or for all hosts in the run. This
        module is also supported for Windows targets.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- aggregate
        Whether the provided value is aggregated to the existing stat `yes' or will replace it `no'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

= data
        A dictionary of which each key represents a stat (or variable) you want to keep track of.

        type: dict

- per_host
        whether the stats are per host or for all hosts in the run.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * In order for custom stats to be displayed, you must set `show_custom_stats' in `ansible.cfg' or `ANSIBLE_SHOW_CUSTOM_STATS'
        to `yes'.
      * This module is also supported for Windows targets.
