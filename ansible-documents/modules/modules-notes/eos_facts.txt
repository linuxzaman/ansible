> EOS_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/eos/eos_facts.py)

        Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that is running eos.  This module prepends all of the base network fact
        keys with `ansible_net_<fact>'.  The facts module will always collect a base set of facts from the device and can enable or
        disable collection of additional facts.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- auth_pass
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes' with `become_pass'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If `authorize' is false, then this
        argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS' will
        be used instead.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- authorize
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli' and `become: yes'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).
        HORIZONTALLINE
        Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device
        will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment
        variable `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE' will be used instead.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- gather_subset
        When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include all,
        hardware, config, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used with an
        initial `[!]' to specify that a specific subset should not be collected.
        [Default: !config]

- provider
        *Deprecated*
        Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using `connection: network_cli'.
        This option is only required if you are using eAPI.
        For more information please see the L(EOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_eos.html).

              authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value is not specified
