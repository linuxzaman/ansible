> SERVICE_FACTS    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/service_facts.py)

        Return service state information as fact data for various service management utilities

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
NOTES:
      * When accessing the `ansible_facts.services' facts collected by this module, it is recommended to not use "dot notation"
        because services can have a `-' character in their name which would result in invalid "dot notation", such as
        `ansible_facts.services.zuul-gateway'. It is instead recommended to using the string value of the service name as the key
        in order to obtain the fact data value like `ansible_facts.services['zuul-gateway']'


REQUIREMENTS:  Any of the following supported init systems: systemd, sysv, upstart
