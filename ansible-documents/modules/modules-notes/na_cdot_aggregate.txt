        Create or destroy aggregates on NetApp cDOT.

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Updated modules released with increased functionality
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.11
	Alternatives: Use M(na_ontap_aggregate) instead.


  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- disk_count
        Number of disks to place into the aggregate, including parity disks.
        The disks in this newly-created aggregate come from the spare disk pool.
        The smallest disks in this pool join the aggregate first, unless the `disk-size' argument is provided.
        Either `disk-count' or `disks' must be supplied. Range [0..2^31-1].
        Required when `state=present'.
        [Default: (null)]

= hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the ONTAP instance.


= name
        The name of the aggregate to manage.


= password
        Password for the specified user.
        (Aliases: pass)

= state
        Whether the specified aggregate should exist or not.
        (Choices: present, absent)

= username
        This can be a Cluster-scoped or SVM-scoped account, depending on whether a Cluster-level or SVM-level API is required. For more
        information, please read the documentation https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/nmsdk/9.4/.
        (Aliases: user)


NOTES:
      * The modules prefixed with na\\_cdot are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.

        2.2, netapp-lib (2015.9.25). Install using 'pip install netapp-lib'
