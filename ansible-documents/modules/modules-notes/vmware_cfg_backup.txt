> VMWARE_CFG_BACKUP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/vmware/vmware_cfg_backup.py)

        This module can be used to perform various operations related to backup, restore and reset of ESXi host configuration.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- dest
        The destination where the ESXi configuration bundle will be saved. The `dest' can be a folder or a file.
        If `dest' is a folder, the backup file will be saved in the folder with the default filename generated from the ESXi server.
        If `dest' is a file, the backup file will be saved with that filename. The file extension will always be .tgz.
        [Default: (null)]

- esxi_hostname
        Name of ESXi server. This is required only if authentication against a vCenter is done.
        [Default: (null)]

- hostname
        The hostname or IP address of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_HOST' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- password
        The password of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PASSWORD' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: pass, pwd)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- port
        The port number of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_PORT' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        [Default: 443]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.5

- src
        The file containing the ESXi configuration that will be restored.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        If `saved', the .tgz backup bundle will be saved in `dest'.
        If `absent', the host configuration will be reset to default values.
        If `loaded', the backup file in `src' will be loaded to the ESXi host rewriting the hosts settings.
        (Choices: saved, absent, loaded)[Default: (null)]

- username
        The username of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_USER' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Aliases: admin, user)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- validate_certs
        Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to `false' when certificates are not trusted.
        If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable `VMWARE_VALIDATE_CERTS' will be used instead.
        Environment variable support added in Ansible 2.6.
        If set to `yes', please make sure Python >= 2.7.9 is installed on the given machine.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * Tested on ESXi 6.0
