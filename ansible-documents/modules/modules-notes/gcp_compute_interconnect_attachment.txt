> GCP_COMPUTE_INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/cloud/google/gcp_compute_interconnect_attachment.py)

        Represents an InterconnectAttachment (VLAN attachment) resource. For more information, see Creating VLAN Attachments.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= auth_kind
        The type of credential used.
        (Choices: application, machineaccount, serviceaccount)
        type: str

- candidate_subnets
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for
        this attachment.
        All prefixes must be within link-local address space (169.254.0.0/16) and must be /29 or shorter (/28, /27, etc). Google will
        attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied candidate prefix(es). The request will fail if all possible /29s are in use on
        Google's edge. If not supplied, Google will randomly select an unused /29 from all of link-local space.
        [Default: (null)]

- description
        An optional description of this resource.
        [Default: (null)]

- edge_availability_domain
        Desired availability domain for the attachment. Only available for type PARTNER, at creation time. For improved reliability,
        customers should configure a pair of attachments with one per availability domain. The selected availability domain will be
        provided to the Partner via the pairing key so that the provisioned circuit will lie in the specified domain. If not specified,
        the value will default to AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY.
        [Default: (null)]

- interconnect
        URL of the underlying Interconnect object that this attachment's traffic will traverse through. Required if type is DEDICATED,
        must not be set if type is PARTNER.
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
        means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
        except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- project
        The Google Cloud Platform project to use.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

= region
        Region where the regional interconnect attachment resides.


= router
        URL of the cloud router to be used for dynamic routing. This router must be in the same region as this InterconnectAttachment.
        The InterconnectAttachment will automatically connect the Interconnect to the network & region within which the Cloud Router is
        configured.
        This field represents a link to a Router resource in GCP. It can be specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with
        key 'selfLink' and value of your resource's selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register: name-of-resource` to a
        gcp_compute_router task and then set this router field to "{{ name-of-resource }}"


- scopes
        Array of scopes to be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file.
        This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid
        JSON)
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_email
        An optional service account email address if machineaccount is selected and the user does not wish to use the default email.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- service_account_file
        The path of a Service Account JSON file if serviceaccount is selected as type.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path

- state
        Whether the given object should exist in GCP
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- type
        The type of InterconnectAttachment you wish to create. Defaults to DEDICATED.
        (Choices: DEDICATED, PARTNER, PARTNER_PROVIDER)[Default: (null)]

- vlan_tag8021q
        The IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag for this attachment, in the range 2-4094.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_file using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the `GCP_AUTH_KIND' env variable.
      * For authentication, you can set scopes using the `GCP_SCOPES' env variable.
      * Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
      * The `service_account_email' and `service_account_file' options are mutually exclusive.
