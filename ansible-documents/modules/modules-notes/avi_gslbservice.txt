        [Default: (null)]

- enabled
        Enable or disable the gslb service.
        If the gslb service is enabled, then the vips are sent in the dns responses based on reachability and configured algorithm.

- health_monitor_scope
        Health monitor probe can be executed for all the members or it can be executed only for third-party members.
