> BIGIP_DEVICE_AUTH_LDAP    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_device_auth_ldap.py)

        Manage LDAP device authentication settings on BIG-IP.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- bind_dn
        Specifies the distinguished name for the Active Directory or LDAP server user ID.
        The BIG-IP client authentication module does not support Active Directory or LDAP servers that do not perform bind referral when
        authenticating referred accounts.
        Therefore, if you plan to use Active Directory or LDAP as your authentication source and want to use referred accounts, make sure
        your servers perform bind referral.

        When a user attempts to log on, the system replaces `%s' with the name the user specified in the Basic Authentication dialog box,
        and passes that as the distinguished name for the bind operation.
        The system passes the associated password as the password for the bind operation.
        This field can contain only one `%s' and cannot contain any other format specifiers.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
