> VDIRECT_COMMIT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/radware/vdirect_commit.py)

        Commits pending configuration changes on one or more Radware devices via vDirect server. For Alteon ADC device, apply, sync and
        save actions will be performed by default. Skipping of an action is possible by explicit parameter specifying. For Alteon VX
        Container device, no sync operation will be performed since sync action is only relevant for Alteon ADC devices. For DefensePro
        and AppWall devices, a bulk commit action will be performed. Explicit apply, sync and save actions specifying is not relevant.
