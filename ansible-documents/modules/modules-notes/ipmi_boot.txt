        Use this module to manage order of boot devices

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= bootdev
        Set boot device to use on next reboot
        (Choices: network -- Request network boot, floppy -- Boot from floppy, hd -- Boot from hard drive, safe -- Boot from hard drive,
        requesting 'safe mode', optical -- boot from CD/DVD/BD drive, setup -- Boot into setup utility, default -- remove any IPMI
        directed boot device request)

= name
        Hostname or ip address of the BMC.


= password
        Password to connect to the BMC.


- persistent
        If set, ask that system firmware uses this device beyond next boot. Be aware many systems do not honor this.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- port
        Remote RMCP port.
        [Default: 623]

- state
        Whether to ensure that boot devices is desired.
        (Choices: present -- Request system turn on, absent -- Request system turn on)[Default: present]

- uefiboot
        If set, request UEFI boot explicitly. Strictly speaking, the spec suggests that if not set, the system should BIOS boot and
        offers no "don't care" option. In practice, this flag not being set does not preclude UEFI boot on any system I've encountered.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

= user
        Username to use to connect to the BMC.
