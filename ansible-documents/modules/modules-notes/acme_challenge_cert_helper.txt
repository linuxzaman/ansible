> ACME_CHALLENGE_CERT_HELPER    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/crypto/acme/acme_challenge_cert_helper.py)

        Prepares certificates for ACME challenges such as `tls-alpn-01'. The raw data is provided by the [acme_certificate] module, and
        needs to be converted to a certificate to be used for challenge validation. This module provides a simple way to generate the
        required certificates. The `tls-alpn-01' implementation is based on L(the draft-05 version of the
        specification,https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-tls-alpn-05).

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= challenge
        The challenge type.
        (Choices: tls-alpn-01)
        type: str

= challenge_data
        The `challenge_data' entry provided by [acme_certificate] for the challenge.

        type: dict

- private_key_content
        Content of the private key to use for this challenge certificate.
        Mutually exclusive with `private_key_src'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- private_key_src
        Path to a file containing the private key file to use for this challenge certificate.
        Mutually exclusive with `private_key_content'.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: path
