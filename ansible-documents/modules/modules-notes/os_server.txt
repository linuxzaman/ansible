  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- api_timeout
        How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will be passed to the requests
        library.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: int

- auth
        Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default `password' plugin, this
        would contain `auth_url', `username', `password', `project_name' and any information about domains (for example,
        `os_user_domain_name' or `os_project_domain_name') if the cloud supports them. For other plugins, this param will need to contain
        whatever parameters that auth plugin requires. This parameter is not needed if a named cloud is provided or OpenStack OS_*
        environment variables are present.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: dict

- auth_type
        Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name of the plugin should be
        indicated here and the contents of the `auth' parameter should be updated accordingly.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- auto_ip
        Ensure instance has public ip however the cloud wants to do that
        (Aliases: auto_floating_ip, public_ip)[Default: yes]

        Availability zone in which to create the server.
        [Default: (null)]

- boot_from_volume
        Should the instance boot from a persistent volume created based on the image given. Mututally exclusive with boot_volume.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- boot_volume
        Volume name or id to use as the volume to boot from. Implies boot_from_volume. Mutually exclusive with image and
        boot_from_volume.
        (Aliases: root_volume)[Default: (null)]

- ca_cert
        A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests.
        (Aliases: cacert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

        A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction.
        (Aliases: cert)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- client_key
        A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction.
        (Aliases: key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- cloud
        Named cloud or cloud config to operate against. If `cloud' is a string, it references a named cloud config as defined in an
        OpenStack clouds.yaml file. Provides default values for `auth' and `auth_type'. This parameter is not needed if `auth' is
        provided or if OpenStack OS_* environment variables are present. If `cloud' is a dict, it contains a complete cloud configuration
        like would be in a section of clouds.yaml.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: raw

- config_drive
        Whether to boot the server with config drive enabled
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- delete_fip
        When `state' is absent and this option is true, any floating IP associated with the instance will be deleted along with the
        instance.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2

- flavor
        The name or id of the flavor in which the new instance has to be created. Mutually exclusive with flavor_ram
        [Default: 1]

- flavor_include
        Text to use to filter flavor names, for the case, such as Rackspace, where there are multiple flavors that have the same ram
        count. flavor_include is a positive match filter - it must exist in the flavor name.
        [Default: (null)]

- flavor_ram
        The minimum amount of ram in MB that the flavor in which the new instance has to be created must have. Mutually exclusive with
        flavor.
        [Default: 1]

- floating_ip_pools
        Name of floating IP pool from which to choose a floating IP
        [Default: (null)]

- floating_ips
        list of valid floating IPs that pre-exist to assign to this node
        [Default: (null)]

= image
        The name or id of the base image to boot.


- image_exclude
        Text to use to filter image names, for the case, such as HP, where there are multiple image names matching the common identifying
        portions. image_exclude is a negative match filter - it is text that may not exist in the image name. Defaults to "(deprecated)"
        [Default: (null)]

- interface
        Endpoint URL type to fetch from the service catalog.
        (Aliases: endpoint_type)(Choices: admin, internal, public)[Default: public]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

- key_name
        The key pair name to be used when creating a instance
        [Default: (null)]

- meta
        A list of key value pairs that should be provided as a metadata to the new instance or a string containing a list of key-value
        pairs. Eg:  meta: "key1=value1,key2=value2"
        [Default: (null)]

= name
        Name that has to be given to the instance. It is also possible to specify the ID of the instance instead of its name if `state'
        is `absent'.


- network
        Name or ID of a network to attach this instance to. A simpler version of the nics parameter, only one of network or nics should
        be supplied.
        [Default: (null)]

- nics
        A list of networks to which the instance's interface should be attached. Networks may be referenced by net-id/net-name/port-id or
        port-name.
        Also this accepts a string containing a list of (net/port)-(id/name) Eg: nics: "net-id=uuid-1,port-name=myport" Only one of
        network or nics should be supplied.
        [Default: (null)]

- region_name
        Name of the region.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- reuse_ips
        When `auto_ip' is true and this option is true, the `auto_ip' code will attempt to re-use unassigned floating ips in the project
        before creating a new one. It is important to note that it is impossible to safely do this concurrently, so if your use case
        involves concurrent server creation, it is highly recommended to set this to false and to delete the floating ip associated with
        a server when the server is deleted using `delete_fip'.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2

- scheduler_hints
        Arbitrary key/value pairs to the scheduler for custom use
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.1

- security_groups
        Names of the security groups to which the instance should be added. This may be a YAML list or a comma separated string.
        [Default: (null)]

- state
        Should the resource be present or absent.
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

- terminate_volume
        If `yes', delete volume when deleting instance (if booted from volume)
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- timeout
        The amount of time the module should wait for the instance to get into active state.
        [Default: 180]
        type: int

- userdata
        Opaque blob of data which is made available to the instance
        [Default: (null)]

- validate_certs
        Whether or not SSL API requests should be verified.
        Before Ansible 2.3 this defaulted to `yes'.
        (Aliases: verify)[Default: False]
        type: bool

- volume_size
        The size of the volume to create in GB if booting from volume based on an image.
        [Default: (null)]

- volumes
        A list of preexisting volumes names or ids to attach to the instance
        [Default: []]

- wait
        If the module should wait for the instance to be created.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * The standard OpenStack environment variables, such as `OS_USERNAME' may be used instead of providing explicit values.
      * Auth information is driven by openstacksdk, which means that values can come from a yaml config file in
        /etc/ansible/openstack.yaml, /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml or ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml, then from standard environment
        variables, then finally by explicit parameters in plays. More information can be found at
        https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/


REQUIREMENTS:  openstacksdk, python >= 2.7
