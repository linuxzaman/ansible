        Create, Update or Destroy a Forwarding_Rule. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/target-proxies for an
        overview. More details on the Global Forwarding_Rule API can be found at

DEPRECATED: 

	Reason: Updated modules released with increased functionality
	Will be removed in: Ansible 2.12
	Alternatives: Use M(gcp_compute_forwarding_rule) or M(gcp_compute_global_forwarding_rule) instead.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- address
        IPv4 or named IP address. Must be of the same scope (regional, global). Reserved addresses can (and probably should) be used for
        global forwarding rules. You may reserve IPs from the console or via the gce_eip module.
        [Default: (null)]

= forwarding_rule_name
        Name of the Forwarding_Rule.


- port_range
        For global forwarding rules, must be set to 80 or 8080 for TargetHttpProxy, and 443 for TargetHttpsProxy or TargetSslProxy.
        [Default: (null)]

- protocol
        For global forwarding rules, TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP. Default is TCP.
        [Default: (null)]

- region
        The region for this forwarding rule. Currently, only 'global' is supported.
        [Default: (null)]

= state
        The state of the Forwarding Rule. 'present' or 'absent'
        (Choices: present, absent)

- target
        Target resource for forwarding rule. For global proxy, this is a Global TargetProxy resource. Required for external load
        balancing (including Global load balancing)
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * Currently only supports global forwarding rules. As such, Load Balancing Scheme is always EXTERNAL.
