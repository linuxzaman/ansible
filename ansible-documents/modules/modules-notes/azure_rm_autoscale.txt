OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- ad_user
        Active Directory username. Use when authenticating with an Active Directory user rather than service principal.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- adfs_authority_url
        Azure AD authority url. Use when authenticating with Username/password, and has your own ADFS authority.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.6

- api_profile
        Selects an API profile to use when communicating with Azure services. Default value of `latest' is appropriate for public clouds;
        future values will allow use with Azure Stack.
        [Default: latest]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

- append_tags
        Use to control if tags field is canonical or just appends to existing tags.
        When canonical, any tags not found in the tags parameter will be removed from the object's metadata.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- auth_source
        Controls the source of the credentials to use for authentication.
        If not specified, ANSIBLE_AZURE_AUTH_SOURCE environment variable will be used and default to `auto' if variable is not defined.
        `auto' will follow the default precedence of module parameters -> environment variables -> default profile in credential file
        `~/.azure/credentials'.
        When set to `cli', the credentials will be sources from the default Azure CLI profile.
        Can also be set via the `ANSIBLE_AZURE_AUTH_SOURCE' environment variable.
        When set to `msi', the host machine must be an azure resource with an enabled MSI extension. `subscription_id' or the environment
        variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID' can be used to identify the subscription ID if the resource is granted access to more than one
        subscription, otherwise the first subscription is chosen.
        The `msi' was added in Ansible 2.6.
        (Choices: auto, cli, credential_file, env, msi)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

- cert_validation_mode
        Controls the certificate validation behavior for Azure endpoints. By default, all modules will validate the server certificate,
        but when an HTTPS proxy is in use, or against Azure Stack, it may be necessary to disable this behavior by passing `ignore'. Can
        also be set via credential file profile or the `AZURE_CERT_VALIDATION' environment variable.
        (Choices: ignore, validate)[Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.5

- client_id
        Azure client ID. Use when authenticating with a Service Principal.
        [Default: (null)]

        For cloud environments other than the US public cloud, the environment name (as defined by Azure Python SDK, eg,
        `AzureChinaCloud', `AzureUSGovernment'), or a metadata discovery endpoint URL (required for Azure Stack). Can also be set via
        credential file profile or the `AZURE_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT' environment variable.
        [Default: AzureCloud]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.4

NOTES:
      * For authentication with Azure you can pass parameters, set environment variables, use a profile stored in
        ~/.azure/credentials, or log in before you run your tasks or playbook with `az login'.
      * Authentication is also possible using a service principal or Active Directory user.
      * To authenticate via service principal, pass subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or set environment variables
        AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_SECRET and AZURE_TENANT.
      * To authenticate via Active Directory user, pass ad_user and password, or set AZURE_AD_USER and AZURE_PASSWORD in the
        environment.
      * Alternatively, credentials can be stored in ~/.azure/credentials. This is an ini file containing a [default] section and
        the following keys: subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or subscription_id, ad_user and password. It is also
        possible to add additional profiles. Specify the profile by passing profile or setting AZURE_PROFILE in the environment.
