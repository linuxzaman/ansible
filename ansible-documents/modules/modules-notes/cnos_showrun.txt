> CNOS_SHOWRUN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/cnos/cnos_showrun.py)

        This module allows you to view the switch running configuration. It executes the display running-config CLI command on a switch
        and returns a file containing the current running configuration of the target network device. This module uses SSH to manage
        network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by
        the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= deviceType
        This specifies the type of device where the method is executed. The choices NE1072T,NE1032,NE1032T,NE10032,NE2572 are added since
        Ansible 2.4. The choice NE0152T is added since 2.8
        (Choices: g8272_cnos, g8296_cnos, g8332_cnos, NE0152T, NE1072T, NE1032, NE1032T, NE10032, NE2572)
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

- enablePassword
        Configures the password used to enter Global Configuration command mode on the switch. If the switch does not request this
        password, the parameter is ignored.While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a
        variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no default value will be used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= host
        This is the variable used to search the hosts file at /etc/ansible/hosts and identify the IP address of the device on which the
        template is going to be applied. Usually the Ansible keyword {{ inventory_hostname }} is specified in the playbook as an
        abstraction of the group of network elements that need to be configured.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= outputfile
        This specifies the file path where the output of each command execution is saved. Each command that is specified in the merged
        template file and each response from the device are saved here. Usually the location is the results folder, but you can choose
        another location based on your write permission.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= password
        Configures the password used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the password parameter is used to
        authenticate the SSH session. While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a
        variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no default value will be used.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3

= username
        Configures the username used to authenticate the connection to the remote device. The value of the username parameter is used to
        authenticate the SSH session. While generally the value should come from the inventory file, you can also specify it as a
        variable. This parameter is optional. If it is not specified, no default value will be used.

        type: str
        version_added: 2.3
