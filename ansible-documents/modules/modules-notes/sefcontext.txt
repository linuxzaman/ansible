> SEFCONTEXT    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/sefcontext.py)

        Manages SELinux file context mapping definitions. Similar to the `semanage fcontext' command.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- ftype
        The file type that should have SELinux contexts applied.
        The following file type options are available:
        `a' for all files,
        `b' for block devices,
        `c' for character devices,
        `d' for directories,
        `f' for regular files,
        `l' for symbolic links,
        `p' for named pipes,
        `s' for socket files.
        (Choices: a, b, c, d, f, l, p, s)[Default: a]
        type: str

- ignore_selinux_state
        Useful for scenarios (chrooted environment) that you can't get the real SELinux state.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- reload
        Reload SELinux policy after commit.
        Note that this does not apply SELinux file contexts to existing files.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

- selevel
        SELinux range for the specified target.
        (Aliases: serange)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

= setype
        SELinux type for the specified target.

        type: str

- seuser
        SELinux user for the specified target.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- state
        Whether the SELinux file context must be `absent' or `present'.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]
        type: str

= target
        Target path (expression).
        (Aliases: path)
        type: str


NOTES:
      * The changes are persistent across reboots.
      * The [sefcontext] module does not modify existing files to the new SELinux context(s), so it is advisable to first create
        the SELinux file contexts before creating files, or run `restorecon' manually for the existing files that require the new
        SELinux file contexts.
      * Not applying SELinux fcontexts to existing files is a deliberate decision as it would be unclear what reported changes
        would entail to, and there's no guarantee that applying SELinux fcontext does not pick up other unrelated prior changes.
