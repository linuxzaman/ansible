        Allows for easy creation, updating and deletion of CloudFront distributions.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- alias
        The name of an alias (CNAME) that is used in a distribution. This is used to effectively reference a distribution by its alias as
        an alias can only be used by one distribution per AWS account. This variable avoids having to provide the `distribution_id' as
        well as the `e_tag', or `caller_reference' of an existing distribution.
        [Default: (null)]

- aliases
        A `list[]' of domain name aliases (CNAMEs) as strings to be used for the distribution. Each alias must be unique across all
        distribution for the AWS account.
        [Default: (null)]

- aws_access_key
        AWS access key. If not set then the value of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_access_key, access_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- aws_secret_key
        AWS secret key. If not set then the value of the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, or EC2_SECRET_KEY environment variable is
        used.
        (Aliases: ec2_secret_key, secret_key)[Default: (null)]
        type: str

- cache_behaviors
        A config element that is a `list[]' of complex cache behavior objects to be specified for the distribution. The order of the list
        is preserved across runs unless `purge_cache_behavior' is enabled. Each cache behavior comprises the attributes `path_pattern'
        `target_origin_id' `forwarded_values' `query_string' `cookies' `forward' `whitelisted_names' `headers[]'
        `query_string_cache_keys[]' `trusted_signers' `enabled' `items[]' `viewer_protocol_policy' `min_ttl' `allowed_methods' `items[]'
        `cached_methods[]' `smooth_streaming' `default_ttl' `max_ttl' `compress' `lambda_function_associations[]'
        `field_level_encryption_id'
        [Default: (null)]

- caller_reference
        A unique identifier for creating and updating cloudfront distributions. Each caller reference must be unique across all
        distributions. e.g. a caller reference used in a web distribution cannot be reused in a streaming distribution. This parameter
        can be used instead of `distribution_id' to reference an existing distribution. If not specified, this defaults to a datetime
        stamp of the format 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff'.
        [Default: (null)]

- comment
        A comment that describes the cloudfront distribution. If not specified, it defaults to a generic message that it has been created
        with Ansible, and a datetime stamp.
        [Default: (null)]

- custom_error_responses
        A config element that is a `list[]' of complex custom error responses to be specified for the distribution. This attribute
        configures custom http error messages returned to the user. Each custom error response object comprises the attributes
        `error_code' `response_page_path' `response_code' `error_caching_min_ttl'
        [Default: (null)]

- debug_botocore_endpoint_logs
        Use a botocore.endpoint logger to parse the unique (rather than total) "resource:action" API calls made during a task, outputing
        the set to the resource_actions key in the task results. Use the aws_resource_action callback to output to total list made during
        a playbook. The ANSIBLE_DEBUG_BOTOCORE_LOGS environment variable may also be used.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- default_cache_behavior
        A config element that is a complex object specifying the default cache behavior of the distribution. If not specified, the
        `target_origin_id' is defined as the `target_origin_id' of the first valid `cache_behavior' in `cache_behaviors' with defaults.
        The default cache behavior comprises the attributes `target_origin_id' `forwarded_values' `query_string' `cookies' `forward'
        `whitelisted_names' `headers[]' `query_string_cache_keys[]' `trusted_signers' `enabled' `items[]' `viewer_protocol_policy'
        `min_ttl' `allowed_methods' `items[]' `cached_methods[]' `smooth_streaming' `default_ttl' `max_ttl' `compress'
        `lambda_function_associations[]' `lambda_function_arn' `event_type' `field_level_encryption_id'
        [Default: (null)]

- default_origin_domain_name
        The domain name to use for an origin if no `origins' have been specified. Should only be used on a first run of generating a
        distribution and not on subsequent runs. Should not be used in conjunction with `distribution_id', `caller_reference' or `alias'.
        [Default: (null)]

- default_origin_path
        The default origin path to specify for an origin if no `origins' have been specified. Defaults to empty if not specified.
        [Default: (null)]

- default_root_object
        A config element that specifies the path to request when the user requests the origin. e.g. if specified as 'index.html', this
        maps to www.example.com/index.html when www.example.com is called by the user. This prevents the entire distribution origin from
        being exposed at the root.
        [Default: (null)]

- distribution_id
        The id of the cloudfront distribution. This parameter can be exchanged with `alias' or `caller_reference' and is used in
        conjunction with `e_tag'.
        [Default: (null)]

- e_tag
        A unique identifier of a modified or existing distribution. Used in conjunction with `distribution_id'. Is determined
        automatically if not specified.
        [Default: (null)]

- ec2_url
        Url to use to connect to EC2 or your Eucalyptus cloud (by default the module will use EC2 endpoints). Ignored for modules where
        region is required. Must be specified for all other modules if region is not used. If not set then the value of the EC2_URL
        environment variable, if any, is used.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- enabled
        A boolean value that specifies whether the distribution is enabled or disabled.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool

- http_version
        The version of the http protocol to use for the distribution.

        Determines whether IPv6 support is enabled or not.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

- logging
        A config element that is a complex object that defines logging for the distribution. The logging object comprises the attributes
        `enabled' `include_cookies' `bucket' `prefix'
        [Default: (null)]

- origins
        A config element that is a `list[]' of complex origin objects to be specified for the distribution. Used for creating and
        updating distributions. Each origin item comprises the attributes `id' `domain_name' (defaults to default_origin_domain_name if
        not specified) `origin_path' (defaults to default_origin_path if not specified) `custom_headers[]' `header_name' `header_value'

        `purge_tags=no', existing tags are kept and `tags' are added, if specified.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool

NOTES:
      * If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of
        precedence `AWS_URL' or `EC2_URL', `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY' or `EC2_ACCESS_KEY', `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' or
        `AWS_SECRET_KEY' or `EC2_SECRET_KEY', `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN' or `EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN', `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION'
      * Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See
        https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
      * `AWS_REGION' or `EC2_REGION' can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be
        configured in the boto config file


REQUIREMENTS:  boto, boto3 >= 1.0.0, python >= 2.6
