        Manage (Enable/Disable) RHSM repositories to the Red Hat Subscription Management entitlement platform using the `subscription-
        manager' command.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= name
        The ID of repositories to enable.
        To operate on several repositories this can accept a comma separated list or a YAML list.


- purge
        Disable all currently enabled repositories that are not not specified in `name'. Only set this to `True' if passing in a list of
        repositories to the `name' field. Using this with `loop' will most likely not have the desired result.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

= state
        If state is equal to present or disabled, indicates the desired repository state.
        (Choices: present, enabled, absent, disabled)[Default: present]


NOTES:
      * In order to manage RHSM repositories the system must be already registered to RHSM manually or using the Ansible
        `redhat_subscription' module.
