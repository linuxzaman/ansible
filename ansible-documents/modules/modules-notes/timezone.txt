> TIMEZONE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/system/timezone.py)

        This module configures the timezone setting, both of the system clock and of the hardware clock. If you want to set up the NTP,
        use [service] module. It is recommended to restart `crond' after changing the timezone, otherwise the jobs may run at the wrong
        time. Several different tools are used depending on the OS/Distribution involved. For Linux it can use `timedatectl' or edit
        `/etc/sysconfig/clock' or `/etc/timezone' and `hwclock'. On SmartOS, `sm-set-timezone', for macOS, `systemsetup', for BSD,
        `/etc/localtime' is modified. As of Ansible 2.3 support was added for SmartOS and BSDs. As of Ansible 2.4 support was added for
        macOS. Windows, AIX and HPUX are not supported, please let us know if you find any other OS/distro in which this fails.
