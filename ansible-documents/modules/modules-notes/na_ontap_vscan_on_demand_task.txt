NOTES:
      * The modules prefixed with na\\_ontap are built to support the ONTAP storage platform.


REQUIREMENTS:  A physical or virtual clustered Data ONTAP system. The modules support Data ONTAP 9.1 and onward, Ansible 2.6, Python2
        netapp-lib (2017.10.30) or later. Install using 'pip install netapp-lib', Python3 netapp-lib (2018.11.13) or
        later. Install using 'pip install netapp-lib', To enable http on the cluster you must run the following commands
        'set -privilege advanced;' 'system services web modify -http-enabled true;'
