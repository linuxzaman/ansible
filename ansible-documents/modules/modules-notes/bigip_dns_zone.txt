> BIGIP_DNS_ZONE    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/network/f5/bigip_dns_zone.py)

        Manage DNS zones on BIG-IP. The zones managed here are primarily used for configuring DNS Express on BIG-IP. This module does not
        configure zones that are found in BIG-IP ZoneRunner.

  * This module is maintained by an Ansible Partner
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

          allow_notify_from:
            description:
            - Specifies the IP addresses from which the system accepts NOTIFY messages for
              this DNS Express zone.
            type: list
          enabled:
            description:
            - Specifies the current status of the DNS Express zone.
            type: bool
          notify_action:

            description:
            - Specifies the action the system takes when a NOTIFY message is received for
              this DNS Express zone.
            - If a TSIG key is configured for the zone, the signature is only validated for
              `consume' and `repeat' actions.
            - When `consume', the NOTIFY message is seen only by DNS Express.
            - When `bypass', the NOTIFY message does not go to DNS Express, but instead goes
              to a back-end DNS server (subject to the value of the Unhandled Query Action
              configured in the DNS profile applied to the listener that handles the DNS request).

              DNS server.

NOTES:
      * For more information on using Ansible to manage F5 Networks devices see https://www.ansible.com/integrations/networks/f5.
      * Requires BIG-IP software version >= 12.
      * The F5 modules only manipulate the running configuration of the F5 product. To ensure that BIG-IP specific configuration
        persists to disk, be sure to include at least one task that uses the [bigip_config] module to save the running
        configuration. Refer to the module's documentation for the correct usage of the module to save your running configuration.
