> WAKEONLAN    (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/modules/remote_management/wakeonlan.py)

        The `wakeonlan' module sends magic Wake-on-LAN (WoL) broadcast packets.

  * This module is maintained by The Ansible Community
OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- broadcast
        Network broadcast address to use for broadcasting magic Wake-on-LAN packet.
        [Default: 255.255.255.255]

= mac
        MAC address to send Wake-on-LAN broadcast packet for.


- port
        UDP port to use for magic Wake-on-LAN packet.
        [Default: 7]


NOTES:
      * This module sends a magic packet, without knowing whether it worked
      * Only works if the target system was properly configured for Wake-on-LAN (in the BIOS and/or the OS)
      * Some BIOSes have a different (configurable) Wake-on-LAN boot order (i.e. PXE first).
